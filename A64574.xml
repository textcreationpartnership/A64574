            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THe Author of theſe Enſuing Diſcourfes, who is, as 'tis hoped, yet Living at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> hath his Name in an high degree of Merit amongſt the Prime Phyſicians and Chymiſts of this Age; His knowledge in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrical</hi> Art (in the judgement of thoſe Emunct and Sagacious perſons, who have Studied the Controverſie betwixt Them) far exceeding <hi>That</hi> of <hi>Zwelfer,</hi> his Antagoniſt; who during this whole Treatife, goes under the name of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former,</hi> for the reaſon mentioned p. 2. The Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation it Self was not performed without Labour and Sweat, partly becauſe the Editions which were made uſe of, one from <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Leyden,</hi> were very unperfect and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect; partly alſo, becauſe, The Author being more intent on <hi>Matter</hi> than <hi>Words,</hi> on <hi>Things</hi> than <hi>Expreſſions</hi> ('tis his own Apology, p. 4.) doth ſometimes leave his Senſe to be picked out by the Analogy of his Doctrine. If moroſe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percilious Cenſurers ſhall object Impoliteneſs, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeciſme, Inept Cadencys and Cohaeſions of Words and Sentences; Obſcurities, length of Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes's,
<pb facs="tcp:35121:4"/>and other flawes uſually incident, or at leaſt imputed to Tranſlations: In bar to ſuch Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percriticks, I offer the particulars following, <hi>viz. That</hi> every Language hath its <hi>Idiom,</hi> which is not properly transferrable to another; <hi>That</hi> a <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlator</hi> is no <hi>Paraphraſt,</hi> but being limited to the <hi>Senſe,</hi> and in great part confined to the <hi>Words</hi> of his Author, hath no allowable Liberty to make Excurſions, or to add any explanatory Embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to another Man's <hi>Work:</hi> It is <hi>his</hi> Province to write by the Copy before him <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to Veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and Overtake the Author's Senſe, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to render it; which I hope is here, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily performed; As for the <hi>Obſcurity</hi> objected, The <hi>Doctrine</hi> it ſelf muſt bear part of the <hi>Guilt</hi> (if any he) For <hi>That</hi> being <hi>Novel,</hi> or at leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived from Antiquity, may not perhaps be ſo clearly and Apodictically explained in a <hi>Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> (which the Author intimates more than once) as to ſtop the Mouths of all Gain-ſayers, though plainly enough (eſpecially with the addition of the <hi>Clavis</hi>) to ſatisfie the Reaſons, and convince the Judgements of Candid and Ingenious Readers. Laſtly, Since 'tis an eaſie thing to be Witty in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Man's Labour, I ſhall conclude with the Poet,</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>THis <hi>Author,</hi> though Printed two or three years ago, came not to our Knowledge, till now: He in his <hi>Tract</hi> endeavours to juſtifie the Ancients blamed by <hi>Zwelfer</hi> in his <hi>Pharmacopaea Auguſtana,</hi> for having committed ſeveral Faults in the preparation of a certain <hi>Salt</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:35121:5"/>call'd <hi>Theriacal,</hi> becauſe extracted out of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,</hi> and diverſe other Ingredients compoſing <hi>Theriack;</hi> and having done this, he thence takes occaſion to Treat of the Nature of <hi>Salts,</hi> eſpecially of <hi>Alcalyes</hi> and <hi>Acids,</hi> which he, with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chymiſts, hold to be the firſt Principles of all mixt Bodies: And being perſwaded that <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> was alſo of this opinion, and a great Chymiſt too, he Entitles His Book <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though the Salt <hi>Alcaly</hi> properly ſignifieth that Salt which is drawn out of the Aſhes of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> Herb, named <hi>Kaly;</hi> yet Chymiſts take it in a larger Senſe, and underſtand by that Word all the Salts, which, like that of the ſaid Herb, draw and impregnate themſelves with, <hi>Acid</hi> ones. To this Salt our Author refers almoſt all the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Nature, and having examined its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, relates divers, not Uncurious Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For Example,</hi> That nothing pierceth ſo much as <hi>Alcalyes,</hi> and that therefore Nature hath ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Sweat</hi> of Animals ſo plentifully with it, for that the Ordure which continually gathers on the Skin, would ſoon ſtop the pores of it, if the <hi>Sweat</hi> were not furniſht with ſome efficatious Diſſolvent to open and pierce Them; Whence he obſerves, that the beſt liquored Boots, and ſuch as are Water-proof, will be quickly pierced by the ſweat of Horſes; adding, that though Riding-poſt, he had, to avoid that inconvenience, rubhed his Boots with a <hi>Vernice,</hi> which reſiſted even to <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> yet the Sweat of the Horſes he rode on diſſolved that fence after the ſecond day of his Voyage.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:35121:5"/>
                  <p> Next, He holds it to be an error to uſe <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> for whitening the Teeth, Experience ſhewing that from the mixture of an <hi>Alcaly</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> there reſults a yellow; and that there is an <hi>Alcaly,</hi> continually tranſpiring out of the Gums, as out of all the other parts of the Body; whence it muſt follow that the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> employed to rub the Teeth, when mixt with that Salt, muſt tinge them of the ſame colour.</p>
                  <p>Then he affirms, that Wood <hi>rotten</hi> hath no <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly</hi> in it, and that it rots not, but upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the exhaling of that Salt, Whence 'tis <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> That the <hi>Venetians</hi> to harden the Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber deſigned for building of Ships, ſink it green in Water, and there leave it many years, which is the cauſe, That the <hi>Alcaly</hi> having been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from exhaling, the Timber rots not, but becomes as hard in a manner as <hi>Stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We cannot pretermit taking notice, That this Author finds occaſion in this Book to explain the way by which the Famous <hi>Turnheiſer,</hi> a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Chymiſt made that celebrated <hi>Nail,</hi> half Gold and half Iron; which is ſhewed at <hi>Florence</hi> in the Repoſitory of the Great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> 'Tis ſaid, that <hi>That Chymiſt,</hi> having in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that <hi>Prince,</hi> immerſed in a certain Oyl, the one half of a Nail which appeared to be all Iron, that part which touched the Oyl, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly found to be good Gold: Several perſons having examined this <hi>Nail,</hi> and ſeeing the Gold and Iron, exceeding well conjoyned, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it could not well be effected, but by a true change of one of thoſe two Metals into the other; believing it impoſſible they could be So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb facs="tcp:35121:6"/>together. But the <hi>Author</hi> of this Book maketh that a very eaſie thing, if the Iron be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore prepared after a certain manner, which He teacheth; and He pretends, That That was the whole Secret of <hi>Turnheiſer,</hi> the reſt being nothing but Illuſion; for after he had by that means So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered together a piece of Gold with half a Nail, He knew ſo well to give the colour of <hi>Iron</hi> to <hi>Gold,</hi> that Men believed that the whole Nail was of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron; and having afterwards put this Nail into the Fire, and held it in the Oyl, to take off that colour, he made appear that <hi>Gold,</hi> which was hid before.</p>

                  <p>At <hi>Vilna,</hi> the Metropolis of <hi>Lituania;</hi> I knew a Silver-Smith, a luſty Fellow, a Batchellor, unlearned,<note place="margin">Silver.</note> yet of ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a memory, that in his own Mother Tongue, he could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat almoſt word for word whatſoever he had once heard.

                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſo much commends?

<pb facs="tcp:35121:12"/>in <hi>Galen</hi>'s time Natural Philoſophy, which now we call <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,</hi> was confined within a few mens breaſts under an Oath of Scoreſie, yet for the ſake thereof <hi>He</hi> travelled over all <hi>Egypt,</hi> where that <hi>Art</hi> moſt flouriſhed at that time; which ſhews the wonderful Curioſity and Diligence of the Man: for returning into his one Country, he diſtributed divers rare Medicines, which he there learned, among ſeveral Phyſicians, his Friends; That ſo they might be approved by their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Thus he wrote of the wonderful efficacy of <hi>Fire</hi> and of <hi>Treacle</hi> to <hi>Piſo,</hi> a Piece mſt worthy to be read: And he high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extols <hi>Aeſchiros,</hi>

                  <p>Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi>'s Praiſe remains entire, and He will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be accounted a moſt ſagacious Perſon; To whom, as well as to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> a Reverence is due, as to the beginners and producers of many, if not all Good Things.</p>
                  <p>So that Natural Philoſophy (not ſtyled <hi>Chymiſtry</hi>) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> is a moſt Ancient Science, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Greek words <hi>'Als,</hi> ſignifying <hi>Salt,</hi> and <hi>Cheo,</hi> to Melt: Hence came the word <hi>Alchymy,</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>The Art of melting Salts.</hi> And 'tis rightly called ſo. For Nature herſelf can produce no fruit at all, unleſs the Internal Salts of the Seeds be diſſolved in the Earth (as I ſhall Ocularly demonstrate:) And theſe once diſſolved, do again act upon one another, and ſo ariſe into a Plant for its peculiar uſes, and then they ceaſe from their labour; for as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, <hi>One Spirit draws too, another thruſts from, both doing the ſame thing, and it inclines to either part (the Encreaſing and Vegetating) and ſo they imitate the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Chymical Philoſopher, inſtructed by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> takes theſe Seeds thus brought by nature to Maturity, and in them conſiders thoſe Two <hi>(Salts)</hi> the Organs of Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire and Water; and by Art, he urges them to action, by melting the Salts according to Natures Law, as <hi>Alchymy</hi> teaches, and then a new thing is produced, which was not before; for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Bread,</hi> In This the <hi>Hyppocratiſt</hi> or <hi>Chymiſt</hi> again takes into conſideration, the Inſtruments of Nature; which he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſts by his helping-hand, melting the Salts; and imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Nature, he again brings forth a new Production, which
<pb facs="tcp:35121:12"/>we call <hi>Vinegar:</hi> Now the <hi>Chymiſt</hi> obſerving that in this Vinegar the <hi>Fire</hi> doth exceed the <hi>Water</hi> (our Master teaching, <hi>That no Sapor ſhould overcome by its proper faculty:</hi>) He therefore conſumes the <hi>Acid</hi> part by its contrary, and again di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the <hi>Fire</hi> from the <hi>Water,</hi> and ſo a new Production called <hi>Hot-water</hi> is generated, which afterwards by the occult help of Art, is fixed into an <hi>Alcaly;</hi> and ſo the Curious <hi>Hippocratilt</hi> goes on mixing and ulcering, till he obtains his intent: And at laſt he deſtroys both the Inſtruments or Faculties by repeated meltings of the Salts. And though hereby he may ſeem to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Perſons to have produced ſome <hi>New</hi> things, yet there is no ſuch matter, for the things are moſt <hi>Ancient,</hi> only he melts and re-melts the Salts as often as the Laws of Nature will permit; which is not beyond the <hi>fourth</hi> Repetition, as<note n="*" place="margin">Dee, Holland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> Learned Men with reaſon ſay. But of this enough at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhews that this repeated Fuſion-melting, and Exaltation of Salts, honoured by the Ancients with the Title of <hi>Alchymy,</hi> hath place, not only in the <hi>Vegetable,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">L. 1. De Diaet.</note> but alſo in the <hi>Mineral</hi> Kingdome; for, ſays he, <hi>Gold work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do beat Gold, waſh it, and melt it with a ſoft Fire, for it will not be made up with a ſtrong.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Galen</hi> had no knowledge of Metals, or of Quick ſilver.</note> By which ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he diſcovers the ignorance and unskilfulneſs of Thoſe, who write that <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is exerciſed about the ignoble fuſion of Metals and Minerals, as if theſe would be melted with a <hi>ſoft</hi> Fire; but the contrary is well known to ſuch who have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen either of them to be melted; for Gold requires not a gentle, but a very ſtrong Fire; Wherefore the Philoſopher doth not here underſtand this rude war of Operation, though he takes his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from it; which he preſently clears by a plain familiar example: <hi>Man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>doth threſh, waſh, and grinde Bread corn, and baking it, he uſes not a ſtrong Fire to make it up in a body, but a ſoft and gentle one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Fire of the <hi>Chymical Philoſopher</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of Animals, Minerals, or Vegetables (called <hi>Small Elixirs</hi> by the <hi>Modernes</hi>) muſt be moderate. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teaches, <hi>All things to be like which were unlike.</hi> But as ſoon as Fire exceeds the degree of being <hi>moderate,</hi> 'tis no longer the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> fire, but <hi>the Artiſts;</hi> for then things are not <hi>advanced</hi> by the intervention thereof, but are <hi>altered</hi> thereby, as our <hi>Maſter</hi> teacheth in the fore-cited Book.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:35121:13"/>
                  <p> Whoſoever therefore do apply themſelves to the <hi>Fuſion</hi> or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation</hi> of Salts, either with a <hi>gentle</hi> or a <hi>vehement</hi> heat, They all have their dependance on this <hi>Ancient Chymical Philoſophy;</hi> So that ſuch perſons are in a groſs and ignorant Miſtake in the judgement of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who exclude A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecaries from this Art. For when <hi>Pharmacopaeans</hi> do pound Vegetables, and wring out their Juice, then it is that they make a fuſion of Salts, expelling and thruſting out the Exotick and Forrain, not being of one and the ſame temper (they are <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his words) but when they condenſe the melted Salts with Sugar into a Syrup, then they throughly mix and alter them; <hi>So 'tis,</hi> ſays <hi>Hippocrates, with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, all Arts communicating with humane Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore if <hi>Nature</hi> do precede <hi>Art,</hi> and <hi>Art</hi> doth but imitate <hi>Nature,</hi> there is no man under the Sun, who hath not within himſelf, as it were a Chymical and Salt-melting ſhop; only the <hi>Canonical Phyſician,</hi> who bears an hatred to the opinions of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> by reaſon of his ignorance of this <hi>Ancient Art,</hi> excepts himſelf, as being altogether unacquainted with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpired <hi>Science.</hi> And by means of ſuch <hi>Ignoramus's, Phyſick</hi> is accounted the meaneſt of all Profeſſions, for it hath no foundation to build upon: Of ſuch <hi>Ignorants, Seneca</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>That they are always learning, but never attain to the knowledge of the Truth.</hi>

                     <p>But for my part I cannot ſee that the Ancients deſerve to be accuſed of abſurdity or ſimplicity in this thing, ſo as to incur the undue reprehenſion of the Reformer: ſo thet before we judge, we are to hear, and that both ſides; and we ought to find out what the <hi>Sal Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack</hi> of the Ancients was, and for what reaſon they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted it in the room of Common Salt? and for what end? and wherein their offence lay? ſo as to merit the raſh anger and bitter deſpight of this Reformer.</p>
                     <p>To make theſe things more plain, it is neceſſary that we dive into the ſecret nature of certain Salts,<note place="margin">No imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things here.</note> in order to the examination and underſtanding of them, and of the differences between them, by accidents proper to them, and known to Senſe, and that not by Logical and convertible Syllogiſmes, or imaginary Non-Entities, but by an Experimental and Natural Hiſtory: I ſay then, and am ready to prove, that not Animals only have Volatile Salt, but, againſt the Opinion of this Reformer, that all Vegetables alſo have not a grain of fixed Salt by Nature, unleſs they acquire it by Ary. But firſt I will ſpeak of things more known, proceeding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by degrees, to thoſe which are more occult. <hi>Pliny</hi> witneſſeth, that Natural <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> was in great uſe amonſt the Ancients; <hi>It is found,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> Ch. <hi>7.</hi>

But there are ſome Sophiſters and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors who give forth, that this Liquor is diſtilled in a <hi>Lembick,</hi> for they mix the foreſaid Liquor with Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and Powdered Flints in a fourfold proportion, and diſtil it with an open fire into an <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit, which by a wrong name they call <hi>Spiritus Calcis Baſilii.</hi> Now let us ſee to what Original or Parent, we may aſcribe the foreſaid diſtilled Spirit.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, they mix this Salt with the Calcined Flints <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with the unſlaked Lime, which abounds more with <hi>Alcaly</hi> than <hi>Acid,</hi> as I have ſhewed in Glaſs and Soap.</p>

                     <p>Hence we learn, that in a fire ſtronger than the nature of the thing will bear, Salts will be fixed, and converted into a Neutral thing; wherefore many things are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſole Regiment of Fire, not as if they were entirely generated anew, and brought forth to light for increaſe (as the vulgar, being ignorant of this <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> Learning, do ſuppoſe) but only by a ſimple altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Subject, as my <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhews;<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> de Diet.</note> and they alſo know, who have skill to make an Harmonious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction between the External and Internal.</p>

Minerals, of what kind ſoever, having in them hidden Metalline Bodies, are joyned with <hi>Acids, (i.e.)</hi> Sulphur of ſeveral ſorts, which do hinder the Metal from being purged from the impurity of the Mines. In this ſtreight, it is needful to have recourſe to <hi>Alcalyes,</hi> which do the work ſpeedily: Reducing therefore the Mineral to Powder, they mix it with <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and melt it in a Crucible; the Fuſion is accelerated by <hi>Nitre,</hi> which is kindled with the Sulphur, as part burns away, ſo part with the <hi>Tartar</hi> is turned into <hi>Alcaly;</hi> that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly</hi> abſorbs all the <hi>Acid,</hi> with which otherwiſe all the Metal would fly away; but this way it eaſily goes to bottom, and that Artiſts call <hi>Regulus (i. e.)</hi> pure Metal, free from Sulphur, which again under a Probatory cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell with Lead they further purifie, for which you may conſult the Say-maſters and Refiners, it being my intent to ſpeak only of the Foundation of Salts.</p>
                     <p>I have told you,<note place="margin">Silver flies away with <hi>Acid</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals.</note> that Metals are turned by Acid Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals into Fume, which is manifeſt in Silver melted with Lead in an Earthen Pot made of Pot-aſhes; put the Sulphur piece-meal into it, whoſe acidity as it flies away, it alſo expels the Metal, which you may gather up again with a moiſt Linnen Cloth ſpread abroad in the Chimney.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:35121:23"/>
                     <p> Another Experiment to prove that Metals are carried off by the Acid Mineral, is, that <hi>Cement,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gold ſlies off with the <hi>Acid</hi> Mineral.</note> which is called <hi>Regale,</hi> which is made of common ſalt, and Powder of Bricks, with which they ſtratifie or ſpread over Gold Money bound in with Copper: In this Cement the Gold, without Fuſion, diſmiſſes the Copper, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Acid Spirit of Salt, vaniſhes to ſmoak, which yet carries off with it ſomething of the Gold; but when the Acid Spirit, being loaded with the Gold, aſſays to paſs through the Earthen Covers, the Gold is precipitated, and ſticks to the Covers,<note place="margin">Regulus Antimony.</note> whiles the Spirit corrodes them, which are afterwards pounded together with Quick-ſilver and water: This recollects the Gold, and reſtores it to his Maſter, when it is ſeparated from it through Leather.</p>
                     <p>As Minerals bearing Metals are precipitated into <hi>Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> the ſame way is <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Antimony</hi> precipitated <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Nitre,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Alcaly</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> imblbes the Acid Sulphur from the <hi>Antimony,</hi> and ſegre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates the pure <hi>Regulus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Antimony</hi> is alſo melted with common Salt, but the Acidity of this latter doth corrode the <hi>Antimony</hi> in the vehemency of the fire, and it is raiſed into bubbles, and ſo leſs <hi>Regulus</hi> falls.

                     <p>I Have mentioned already, that amongſt the fixeder ſort of <hi>Alcalyes,</hi> Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> is endued with a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar priviledge; for though it be an heavy Body, terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial, impure,<note place="margin">Gold is almoſt all <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and gives the leaſt <hi>Mercury</hi> of all.</note> and mixed with filth, yet being digeſted with any Metal whatſoever, in a due ſpace of time, it turns it into running <hi>Mercury.</hi> Having experimented this, I affirm it for a truth to convince the incredulous; but if any refuſe to believe it, I am not much ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous.</p>
                     <p>A Friend of mine endeavouring to obtain <hi>Tartar</hi> from generous, mature, and clear Wine, did elicit and draw forth the Spirit, and ſuffered the Phlegme to exhale; the remainder being thick as a Syrup, he permitted to concrete in a cold place, into <hi>Pellucid Tartar,</hi> which he burnt; and as the cuſtom is, with common water ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the <hi>Alcaly,</hi> which he ſuffered to run down into a Liquor of its own accord. A ſudden occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it ſelf, that he was to go to <hi>Rome</hi> with a certain great man; to the end that the precious Liquor might not be loſt in the interim, he commanded his Servant to preſerve it in a Veſſel which he appointed and ſhewed him for that purpoſe; his Servant, by a miſtake, poured it into a Neighbour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But at length he learned out of <hi>Baſilius Valentinus,</hi> that Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> hath this priviledge above all other Salts.</p>
                     <p>The ingenious <hi>Helmont</hi> hath confirmed this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in theſe words; <hi>I have found,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Tract. po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. S. <hi>4.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>There came then to my mind a ſtrong <hi>Lixivium,</hi> wherewith old women boil <hi>Litarge</hi> to black their hair (of which <hi>Porta</hi> alſo makes mention in his <hi>Magia Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralis</hi>) into which I dropped Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the <hi>Alcaly</hi> ſuffered the Metal to run into a white Powder, which I reduced into Lead; by which means, I knew for certain, that <hi>Alcalyes</hi> do inviſibly contain and hide in their Bowels Calcined Metals.</p>
                     <p>This Experiment being made, <hi>Helmont</hi> goes on, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That calcined things are moſt ſharp, but they are dulce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with diſſolved</hi> Sal Armoniack <hi>and putrified</hi> Tartar; <hi>(i.e.)</hi> they are turned into running <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is not any longer tart or biting, as Calcined things are, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid to the taſte.</p>
                     <p>I return now to the Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which in form of Liquor was poured into the <hi>Cucurbite,</hi> in which was Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver corroded by <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with <hi>Sal Armoniack:</hi> All theſe changed their nature into Neutral Salts, different from their former ſtate; ſo the Silver made no more any ſhew of Silver, of which<note n="*" place="margin">Lite. de magno mundi.

                     <p>The Ancients took notice of this fundamental and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick difference (which they call <hi>Occult.</hi>)<note place="margin">The occult quality is the Ferment of the place, of which hereafter.</note> I ſay, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that Volatile Alcaly drinks up as much of <hi>Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi> as is ſufficient for its conſtancy and ſaturity, for artificial <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> ſo that the Alcaly of Urine and the Acid part of the aforeſaid Salt, do ſo ſtrictly embrace one another,<note place="margin">Artificial <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi>
                        </note> that <hi>per ſe,</hi> they cannot be ſeparated, for the Salt of Urine, in the torture of the Fire, ſeeking to eſcape, carries away with it the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid part, which it had abſorbed, and they are both ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated together into artificial <hi>Sal Armoniack.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now, that Common Salt, either Ours, or the <hi>Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack</hi> of the Ancients, hath an Acid part, communicable out of the Fire; is proved by this Experiment; <hi>viz.</hi> Drop Liquor of Tartar upon Salt, when it is reſolved, and in a few moments, you ſhall ſee the earthy part to be ſeparated,<note place="margin">Common Salt is Acid Salt.</note> and the Alcaly of Tartar to embrace the Acid, of which more plainly hereafter: So, without the Art of Diſtillation, the Ancients eſſayed to aſſociate the Alcaly of Vipers with Natural <hi>Sat Armoniack.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wherefore the Ancients, after they had obſerved out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the occult difference of Volatile Alcalies (of Animals) and the Acidity of Common and Cireniack Salt,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1</hi> de Diaet.</note> under the name of <hi>Faculties,</hi> they began to ſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Vipers with Natural Sal-Cireniack or Armoniack, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſaith, in the place before-cited (as they ſaw, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Urine and Salt) to the end that the Alcaly of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers might imbibe as much of the Acid Salt,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> de Diaet.</note> as might
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35121:28"/>ſuffice, for ſtopping its voluntary flight. This Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not altogether without cauſe, they then called <hi>Sal Theriacals, Salt of Treacle;</hi> becauſe they had learned, the Fleſh of Vipers to be good againſt many poiſons (yea by ſuch an ingenious Viperine Decoction, I have more than once cured the French Pox in Curious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) and conſequently by reaſon of its ſeminal and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mial Ferment, that the Alcaly of Vipers, muſt contain the ſame Faculty.</p>
                     <p>This Contemplation of the Ancients is unworthily charged by the Reformer with <hi>childiſhneſs and abſurdity;</hi> He himſelf, being much more abſurd,<note place="margin">F. 481.</note> as not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the memorable Inventions of our Anceſtors.

                     <p>I ſaid in the foregoing Chapter, that the percepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or manifeſt Acidity,<note place="margin">The Analyſis of the Stone.</note> out of the Stomach, was the cauſe of Diſeaſes; which aſſertion, the Compoſition of the Stone doth confirm, which for greater Illuſtration, I will now Mechanically reſolve, and again compound. Take a Stone, cut out from the Bladder, or coming voluntarily from the Reins, (a drachme or two is ſufficient) put it into a Glaſs Retort new and clean (let not the Stone be beat to Powder, but of that bigneſs, that it may not ſtick to the Neck of the Retort) put the Retort into Sand, ſet too a new and clean Receiver, urge it with a moderate Fire; Firſt of all an Alcaly, like Urine, yet of no ſmell, will drop into the Receiver, and a little after, you ſhall ſee the more fixed part of the ſame Alcaly to be ſublimated in the Neck of tho Retort: mix both thoſe Spirits, the Liquid and the Solid, and keep them diligently in a Glaſs Veſſel, ſtopped with Wax, For if it be open, they vaniſh to Air, of which <hi>Hippocrates, taken part it is not ſufficient, either for it ſelf,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">L. i. de Diat.</note> 
                        <hi>or any other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Retort when it is cooled, you ſhall find the pieces of Stone in the ſame form as they were put in, yet ſo light and friable, that if you touch them but lightly, with your finger, they fall to powder, (as dead carkaſſes in <hi>Roma Subterraneâ</hi>) upon which entire pieces, if you again pour the Alcaly reſerved from the ſtone, or elſe other Alcaly of Urine, preſently it hardens, as it was before; which is a ſigne, that the Alcaly, in the aforeſaid cadaver, finds an occult Acid, which may abſorbe it; for unleſs it finds the Acid, it abides not alone in the open Aire, but according to its nature, would vaniſh away, <hi>Becauſe being ſevered,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35121:34"/>they are ſufficient neither for themſelves, nor any other;</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teacheth.</p>
                     <p>Hence we learn, That the Stone (for Example) is not congealed, neither in the Bladder nor in the Reins, unleſs by the Alcaly of Urine, or the Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the place, and the Acid unduly, unproperly, and by miſtake, falling down from the Stomach, and there being degenerated, the Acid and the Alcaly, being joyned there, muſt needs concrete into a Maſſe, as I ſhall every where plainly ſhew) and they lay hold alſo on that which is not much different from their Nature; which, together with theſe two, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo coagulation, as I have ſaid in Calx or Lime, and daily experience alſo witneſſeth.<note place="margin">I know it, ſays the Author of the Roſary, becauſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity the work maſt come to ſuch a Nature</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence Red Stones are congealed by a little Blood, which falls down in the ſame place from the Acid, out of the eroded vein; wherefore they are more friable and brittle; but the other Stones, having muci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage joyned to them, are whiter and thporefore hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This is that, which my <hi>Hippocrates</hi> moſt skilful in <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> doth proclaim. <hi>Theſe things are thus brought to paſs by Divine neceſſity, yet they know not what they do, but every thing fulfils his deſtined fate:</hi> which is, as if he had ſaid, both theſe Spirits or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, being joyned together, in whatſoever place,<note place="margin">L. <hi>1.</hi> de Diat.</note> muſt of neceſſity concrete and congeale, but being ſevered, they effect nothing in Nature, neither can they ſubſiſt, <hi>being neither ſufficient for themſelves or other things,</hi> as my Doctor ſays. So that, manifeſt Acidity without the Stomach, in whatſoever place it be, is Morbous and Inimicous to Nature.</p>
                     <p>This Doctrine of the Old man is moſt true, for it is daily obſerved in practice, that Stones do concrete all vacuities of the body, whereſoever the Acid being out of its place, by miſtake meets with the Alcaly, as in the Lungs, the Liver, the <hi>Vena porta,</hi> the Ureters, the <hi>Inteſtinum Colon,</hi> and the Bladder of the Gaul: which is againſt the moſt Aoute <hi>Galen,</hi>

                     <p>Hence we may learn, of what Vertue in dangerous Diſeaſes, the Water tempered with or poured upon the Stone which is found in the Gaul of an Hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hog, may be; which yet ſome ignorant Practicioners do mightily extol: 'tis a wonder they are not afraid of this Stone, as of an igneous or fiery nature, ſince it is better from the Gaul, which hitherto they have not obſerved. If the ablution of this Stone were good for any thing, furely one drop of the Gaul of the meaneſt Fiſh, were much better then twenty Ablutions thereof.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore from the coagulation of the Stone, it now appears, how far <hi>Lithon-Tribon, Cantharides, the Blood of an Hare, of a Fex,</hi> and the like, have hitherto profited in the Stone; ſo that <hi>Paracelſus</hi> right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly judges, that the Stone (and the Knotty Gout) are coagulated like Tartar, by two Faculties, according to the Doctrine of <hi>Hippocrates (i. e.)</hi> the Acid and the Alcaly; it alſo coagulates with it ſome <hi>foeces,</hi> which by chance it finds there; and <hi>Galen</hi> witneſſes againſt himſelf and his followers,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>7</hi> de Meth.</note> 
                        <hi>The cauſe being known, 'tis eaſy to find the remedy;</hi> and therefore whatſoever of the Stones of Crabs, of <hi>Lapis Judaicus,</hi> of Flints, of the Stones of Carpes, of Perches, and the like, being in Powder, or diſſolved in Vinegar, is taken at the mouth for the Stone, it indeed imbibes the Antecedent cauſe of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulum (i. e.)</hi> the Acid as I have ſhewed; but it doth not abate or diminiſh the Stone, when it is once coagulated. So alſo Salt things, by reaſon of their Acid part, do hinder the concreteing of the Stone, in as much as they conſume and drink up the Alcaly of the Urine, ſo that the Acid roving up and down the Body, can find no Alcaly wherewith to aſſociate or be coagulated; but Salt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35121:35"/>things do not diſſolve the Stone, when it is already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created.</p>
                     <p>But that common Salt doth imbibe and abſorbe into it ſelf the Alcaly of Urine, and other Alcalyes of Animals, as I have ſhewen above in the preparation of Sal-Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, ſo I will now further demonſtrate by another expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.</p>
                     <p>'Tis known, That the fleſh, of whatſoever Animal, is preſerved by common Salt, which in a few days runs down there-from into a Salt Sanguineous Liquor: Boil about a pound of this Liquor, and ſcum it, and put it into a Glaſs Retort, and with a gentle fire, draw forth all the moiſture; laſtly, cover the Retort with ſand, increaſing the fire, then the Alcaly of the fleſh will be elevated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the neck of the Retort (like the Alcaly of Urine;) which the common Salt had abſorbed and drawn out from the fleſh; only by a few days maceration and ſteeping; after the ſame manner, the Salt which we eat, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and drink up the ſuperfluous Alcaly (gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here and there in the Gavities or Ventricles (as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſays) which is unfit for Tranſpiration; reaſon it ſelf dictates this, and experience beareth witneſs thereto; for Alcaly by an eaſy proceſs is ſublimated out of Urine, and the Soa-ſalt remains, as it was eaten, in the bottom,<note place="margin">The Dignity of Common Salt.</note> the ſame way as I juſt now ſhewed, concerning the Salt Liquor of Fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Hence we may gather, That Salt is beſtowed on Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, as a neceſſary ſupport of Health and Life.</p>

If you will call this way of diſſolving, either by its contrary, or by its like, you do not much miſtake, for the Alcaly if it diſſolves, 'tis done by its like; the Acid, if it deſtroys, 'tis done by its contrary: Who (of what Sect ſoever) beſides <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>

                     <p>Drink Vitriol of <hi>Mars,</hi> diſſolved in water, and you ſhall ſee the excrements of the Belly tinged either black or green, after the ſame manner, being precipitated by the inward Alcaly; as I have already declared by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but in the External habit of the body, diſſolved Vitriol is not precipitated by the Effluviums of Salt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it paſſes in greater quantity, to the Inteſtines; So neither is the Urine tinged black, for the <hi>Colcothar</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated before the liquor is hurried to the <hi>Meſaraicks;</hi> ſo that of neceſſity it muſt remain in the Bowels.</p>
                     <p>If therefore the greateſt part of the Excrements paſs to the Bowels, being deſigned by Nature for Expulſion, It is ſometimes by miſtake detained in undue places by the Bonds of Coagulation, or to ſpeak according to <hi>Fernelius</hi> Language in the Firſt Region of the Body, and then of neceſſity it muſt be furthered in order to Expulſion, by ſome Looſning Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; So that it ſeems not to me,<note place="margin">Pargatives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are not ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover health, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teaches.</note> that all Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Medicaments are to be diſallowed in Diſeaſes, as ſome think, <hi>neither are they alone ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure health and recovery,</hi> as the greateſt part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians do believe and practice, againſt the Tenent of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>

                     <p>There is another obſervable thing, that a pure Acid na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirit, cannot be extracted or acquired by any man; for being Diſtilled from <hi>Vitriol,</hi> however rectified, it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver forſakes the <hi>Liquamen</hi> of the Metal; neither can it be precipitated from it, by any Alcaly, after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way; for in theſe it cloaths it-ſelf again with a new body, and returns to what it was, as I have ſhewed in its place, yet <hi>Paracelſus</hi> doth praiſe that Acid Spirit, which is found near the Village <hi>Veltin</hi> in <hi>Helvetia,</hi> as in ſome ſort pure, as I have elſewhere obſerved.</p>

                     <p>But not only waters, Diſtilled from cooling Herbs, but alſo common water both of Wells and Rivers, contains an Occult <hi>Alcaly,</hi> by means whereof it nouriſhes Animals and all Plants; <hi>Red hot Iron, quenched in water, acquires ſtrength thereby,</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teaches in the fore-cited Book, and daily Experience ſhews; for Iron hath too much of the Volatile <hi>Acid,</hi> whence it readily paſſes into Scoria and Ruſt, but when the Acid is imbibed by the Alcaly, then it is made more compact, and reſiſts more; therefore Cutlers of Knives and Swords, anoint their work with ſhavings of Horns, heating their blades till the ſhavings melt, and thus they draw the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly</hi> out of the Horns, and their blades become ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. hence it is, that ſuch as paſs by their ſhops, do ſometimes perceive the ſtinking ſmell of burnt Horns.

This Water is preſcribed to Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe it kills, and expels Worms, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times provokes Vomitting, which Operation, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, is Vulgarly aſcribed to the Roſe-water, whereas Roſe-water is not ſimply cold, but of a temperate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as containing an occult and inſenſible Acidity,<note place="margin">Roſe-water doth not cool unleſs it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled through Lead.</note> which is unſeparable from it, never leaving it, till it be annihilated; but in flowing through a Copper Limbeck, its Occult Acidity abrades and takes off certain Atomes from the Copper, which are inviſibly mixed with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; if you would diſcover or ſeparate the Copper, drop into a little quantity of this water, one or two drops, of the Alcaly of Urine, and preſently all the water turns
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35121:48"/>Green, becauſe the Acidity of the water doth more greedily catch the light Alcaly, more ſimilary to it than the Metal, which therefore by little and little, ſubſides into a greeniſh bottom; Then the ſame water, doth no longer provoke Vomit, nor kill Worms, but will be like <hi>That</hi> which is Diſtilled through Glaſs Veſſels; but melt the green bottom with <hi>Borax,</hi> and then it returns to Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per again.</p>
                     <p>Neither is this Occult Nutritive <hi>Alcaly</hi> found only in Vulnerary and Cooling-herbs,<note place="margin">All Pot-herbs contain a <hi>Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Alcaly</hi> and cooling, and, as all wound herbs beget Milk in Nurſes; for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity</hi> is an hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to Milk.</note> but in all Pot-herbs whatſoever, which are therefore deſired by the Stomach, abounding with <hi>Acidity.</hi> This <hi>Alcaly</hi> is the cauſe that ſuch as eat boiled Cabbage or Coleworts, before a fit of Drinking, are ſeldom inebriated, for the <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> of this Herb, as it moderates the inebriateing <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity</hi> of the Wine in the Stomach, ſo it abſords and conſumes That in the Glaſs.</p>

                     <p>Know then, that no Vegetable hath any fixed Salt, of what kind ſoever, unleſs it be burned with actual Fire; So that the Acid, in burning, may act upon, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Alcaly,<note place="margin">The Air deth Volatize.</note> and likewiſe the Alcaly on the Acid, as I have ſhewed in Juice of Wine, and its Tartar: As may be ſeen in rotten Wood, though you reduce it, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo carefully to Aſhes, in what fire ſoever, you will never get Salt out of it; for the Acid, and the Alcaly, being both Volatile, are already abſumed by the Air, and have left nothing but an unprofitable <hi>Cadaver</hi> behind, but if it be burnt before Putrefaction, then you may obtain your deſire.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore our chief care and labour in this Work, muſt be,<note place="margin">This action may be called <hi>Fermentation,</hi> for the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> that the Herbs may be freſh, and not withered; for then, in burning, the innate Humidity, when it boils up, doth diſſolve the Acid and the Alcaly, which, being diſſolved, do act mutually one upon another, and one apprehending the other, they are both fixed, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the property of the Concrete: But that part, which flies away with the flame, and was not catched by the Acid, turns into Soot, from whence, you may by an eaſy Method, draw forth Volatile Alcaly, but never Fixed Salt, yet by ingenuity it is reduced to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency.</p>
                     <p>This action deſerves to be called <hi>Fermentation,</hi> for both the inſtruments of Nature are changed into one <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,</hi> which, as in the Sope-makers and Glaſs-makers Art, is turned with the Acid, its contrary, into a Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral thing; ſo alſo it happens in Man's body, when it is

                     <p>Take Green <hi>Wormwood</hi> for an Example, when it is green, fet fire to it, and kindle it in a Chimney, or open place, but take great heed that it doth not flame out, tis enough to turn it only into Aſhes, which, after the burning, put in an Earthen-pot, large, and low, or alſo upon an Iron-plate, the edges turned up, and Coals being kindled under it in a Wind-furnace, that the Vent-hole, or Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, as need requires, may be either opened, or ſhut: Stir theſe Aſhes with an Iron Spatule continually, till they be very white, and then lay them in a Linnen-bagg Acuminated (or if there be but few, on Acuminated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) and pour on Common Water, which as it runs through it, being pregnant with Salt, is called a <hi>Lye;</hi> coagulate this ſtrained <hi>Lye</hi> in an Iron Frying-Pan (not greaſed in the Kitchin) with a quick Ebullition, and make it up into a Lump, and when it is as thick, as Honey, continually ſtir it with a Spatule, and it will be dryed into a grey Powder, which preſently put into a Pot not glazed, the mouth of the Wind-furnace being ſtopped, and cover it with ſmall Coals, mixed with their powder, and leiſurely heat it, ſcarce to Brunity, or Browneneſs, but not that it may melt, then cool it, and put the Salt, into a Glaſs Veſſel, that it may be diſſolved in a ſufficient quantity of Water; ſtir it oftentimes with a Woodden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, then ſuffer the Solution to reſt, two or three days, and when it is clear from the Lees, without much ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, pour it out, and in a Leaden, or Glaſs Veſſel, placed in Sand, ſuffer the Water to exhale, without Bubbles, till a Saline-Cuticle grow a-top; then remove the Veſſel, and the next Morning, gather together the ſhining grains of Salt, which you muſt ſwiftly waſh in clear water, and then dry: put again the remaining <hi>Lye,</hi> in the Sand, that the water may exhale, as before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cuticle. Both theſe Salts are to be kept together, in one Veſſel, which being prepared after this manner, do reſemble the Craſis and Diſpoſition of their Concretes.

                     <p> This is the eaſy and natural way of preparing Salts of Vegetables, which do never melt of themſelves, nor are of an ungrateſul taſte: A Pound of theſe Aſhes, will yield near four ounces of the pureſt Salt; but four pound of the Aſhes of dried Herbs, will ſcarce afford an ounce of Salt.</p>

                     <p>The Reformer teaches, that the aſhes are to be boiled, and the Lye thickned to Siecity,<note place="margin">Mant. f. <hi>789.</hi>
                        </note> and afterwards commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the melting fire, without <hi>diſcretion;</hi> So, in the place of the Vegetable Salt, there always comes an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and cauſtick Alcaly; for the Salt of <hi>Wormwood,</hi> in its Fundamental Point, is of the Acid Salt, and not purely fixed, as I have ſhewn; but if it ſuffer Fuſion, then both Taſtes or Sapor act upon one another, and are fixed into an Alcaly, as it happens in all Acid Salts made by Art; wherefore from the Regimen of Fire alone, things are altered, and they change their Name, Vertue and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy. This is the cauſe, that the vertues of Salts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by ignorant Perſons,<note place="margin">Fire is a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Profeſſor.</note> are never equal, <hi>viz.</hi> when they are Alcalyz'd, they are commended by the Unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful (for example, Salt of <hi>Wormwood</hi>) to have done good in the <hi>Collick</hi> (which then came from Acids, which had been drank) but when it is prepared from Salt-Acid, and Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile to boot, by the Skilful, 'tis good for the Stomach, and againſt Old Obſtructions, and is then the Baſis in the Cachectique Powder of <hi>Quercetan.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">A <hi>Cachectick</hi> Powder.</note> The cauſe is aſcribed to Noxious Humours; So, many Salts, are made fixed, if they be managed with a due Heat, and with all Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, as the Subject can bear, which otherwiſe were Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; for the fixation of Blood requires one kind of Heat and Inſtruments;<note place="margin">All things are done by them through Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Neceſſity. <hi>Hipp. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Diaet.</hi>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35121:52"/>when <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> are fixed; So alſo there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother operation of Salts, which are all Volatile, as I have ſhewed in Rotten Wood.</p>
                     <p>This is the reaſon,<note place="margin">The <hi>Venatians</hi> Ingenious.</note> why the wife and prudent Senators of <hi>Venice,</hi> do cauſe the Timber, of which they make their Ships of War, while it is green, to lye under water ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years, in their gallant and well-provided <hi>Arſenal,</hi> leaſt the Air ſhould penetrate it, and by this means, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the water, it becomes almoſt as fixed and as hard, as ſtones.</p>
                     <p>But if it begins to be quailed in the Air, before it be watered, then they muſt burn it a little, that the Acid and Alcaly, may be melted together, and as it were incruſtrated; and ſo it will endure many ages and never rot: In like manner thoſe pieces of Timber are incruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which are rammed into the Earth for Foundations of great Buildings, leaſt they ſhould rot.</p>
                     <p>The Gardeners in theſe Iſlands do reduce their Herbs, being dryed, in the Air or Sun, to Aſhes, and ſell the aſhes on their Words and Credit to the Apothecaries: who, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they can get little, or no Salt out of them, do blame the Gardeners, alledging they were naught; Their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, that in Tranſporting the Aſhes, the Sea-water hath robb'd them of their Salt: many do eaſily believe this Excuſe, being ignorant of any other cauſe.</p>

This Relief, the Superſtitious People of <hi>Greece,</hi> attribute to the Image, before which the Lamp burns; But the true cauſe is, the Spiſſitude in the Lamp, loſes its more ſubtil Acid part by the flame, and ſo being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute thereof, it grows impatient, and deſires to be Saturated with a new Acid, and finding That in the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved part, it draws it out, and unites it, to it ſelf; and ſo the Grief either wholly ceaſes, or is at leaſt mitigated and abated.</p>
                     <p>The Vulgar believe,<note place="margin">Why old Oyl grows mouldy.</note> that Old Oyl is as good as Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam, becauſe the Oyl of a Hundred years old in the Caſtle of <hi>Breſchia,</hi> eaſes many from their pains, ariſing from Acidity; in which Oyl, by reaſon of its antiquity, the Alcaly hath in part maſtered the Acidity, hence at-laſt it grows very muſty; So Venerable Antiquity preſcribes Old Oyl in Compoſitions for External uſe.</p>

                     <p>For heretofore,<note place="margin">Arſenick</note> when (by the perſwaſion of <hi>Johannes Agricola</hi>) I eſſay'd to ſublimate <hi>Arſenick</hi> ſo often, that at length it might remain fixed in the bottom of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, for at that time (out of my eager deſire after Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) I feared neither Smoaks, Vapours, nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther danger: After many Sublimations, when I opened the Veſſel, I ſuck'd in a breath ſo ſweet, ſo grateful and benign to the Palate, that I even admired it, as having never felt the like before; but after half an hour, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my ſtomach to be contracted and to ake, with a convulſion of all my Members, I breathed with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, I piſſed Blood, with incredible Heat; ſuddenly after, I was taken with the <hi>Collick,</hi> and wholly cramped for the ſpace of an hour and half; being recovered by Milk and Oyl, I was indifferent well, yet a ſlow <hi>Feavor,</hi> like a <hi>Hectick,</hi> ſtuck by me all the Winter, which I cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Decoction of Vulnerary Herbs, and eating the tops or buds of Cole-worts and Colly-flowers, boiled tender in Water, and ſeaſoned with juice of Oranges, Oyl, and a little Salt; yea I did ſo covet this meat, that I could ſcarce reſtrain my Appetite, till Supper and Meat-time: and by theſe Remedies, I grew perfectly well.</p>
                     <p>But in ſpight of the danger, there are ſome, who can burn pure Tinn into Powder,<note place="margin">Geber de Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. c. <hi>18. and</hi> Baſil. de Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priet.</note> which, by no Vulgar Art can be again reduced to Tinn, as other Metals; yet with <hi>Arſenick,</hi> it is made <hi>Scoria,</hi> part of which, by a ſingular Skill,<note place="margin">7 Metals <hi>De fove.</hi>

                     <p>Put clean and pure <hi>Mercury</hi> into a Glaſs of a plain bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and very narrow mouth: boil it in Sand, firſt with a ſlow and moderate, afterwards, with a ſtronger fire, to that degree, that <hi>Mercury</hi> may endeavour to aſcend; which, if it happen by a ſimple motion, cauſe it to ſubſide again. This way, without the addition of any thing, but Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fire, it is precipitated ſhining Red, like That,<note place="margin">Sulphur <hi>rubifies</hi> Mercury.</note> which was precipitated with <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> out of <hi>Vitriol</hi> and <hi>Nitre;</hi> and it neither gets, nor loſes in its weight, in as much as the ſmall portion, if its proper <hi>Sulphur</hi> hath mortified and rubified it: as I have ſhewed in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> from <hi>(Sulphureous)</hi> Nitre. For it is the property of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> to rubify <hi>Mercury,</hi> as I have alſo demonſtrated in the preparation of <hi>Cinnabar;</hi> which alſo gets nothing in weight; which our Chymiſts muſt attentively conſider, for it is of concernment.</p>
                     <p>Mingle this red Precipitate (either made <hi>per ſe,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, of whatſoever condition) with Common Salt, urge this <hi>Compoſitum</hi> with a moderate fire, and then it will be elevated into a Sublimate Corroſive: neither doth the Salt here hinder the Acid <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> yea, without Salt, it would never be made Sublimate Corroſive, out of red precipitate, neither would the <hi>Mercury</hi> encreaſe in its weight. So, That precipitate, which <hi>Crollius</hi> calls <hi>Turbith Minerale,</hi> in as much as it is made with Spirit of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Sulphur,</hi> is not red, becauſe little of the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is elevated, without <hi>Nitre,</hi> in the Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35121:63"/>but becauſe of the affinity and ſymbol which it hath in acting, upon the Sulphur of <hi>Mercury,</hi> it grows Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and hath acquired no weight, after the aluminous taſte is waſhed away with hot water.</p>
                     <p>The ſtrength and Vertues of all the aforeſaid Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates are equal, they provoke Vomit, corrupt the Gumms, and, taken often, do cauſe the Execrable <hi>Fty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſm.</hi> Hence <hi>Helmont,</hi>

                     <p>But go to? may we not uſe Vinegar ſimply diſtilled with leſs labour and charge? ſince it is one and the ſame thing?

                     <p>But to contract all in a few words, <hi>The Vinegar and Spirit of Venus</hi> of our Reformer, are nothing but water impregnated with an Acid Volatile Salt, which, if it corrodes any thing, 'tis preſently Coagulated, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by combuſtion is fixed into Alcaly.</p>

                           <hi>f.</hi> 849.</note> The King eſcaped by the help of Fate, and not of the <hi>Narcotick</hi> Sulphur of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which is no where found in the whole Book of Receipts: So alſo he promiſes to Queens a <hi>Ludus Praeparatus</hi> to beget Milk, which yet he never ſaw or knew: Hence came the common Proverb, <hi>Mentiris ut Medicus.</hi> This <hi>Sulphur</hi> of his, and that <hi>Ludus Praeparatus,</hi> change not their Soil, nor paſs beyond the Seas; they like well the place of their Nativity, and love not to ſtir further, <hi>viz.</hi> then the brains of the Reformer.</p>

                  <p>IT was the cuſtome of the Firſt Philoſophers (Moſt Serene and Mighty Prince) that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Secrets of Things, or Myſteries of Nature, they found out, they would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately impoſe Divine Names on them; and ſo, as much as they could, hide them from the Vulgar; or elſe they would relate them under diſguiſed Words, Forreign and unuſual Terms, Allegories, Aenigma's, and Metaphorical Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, either becauſe they feared the offence of the Unskilful Multitude, or elſe being perſwaded, that thoſe Abſtruſe things would meet with no approbation, if they were eaſily underſtood.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> of <hi>Coos,</hi> treading in the ſame ſteps, that Divine and Venerable Old-man, and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly Chief in this moſt Famous Art (in whoſe Praiſes the Ancients, and all Neotericks have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently Expatiated) ſhews the hidden Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Noble Science, in theſe words. <hi>If
<pb facs="tcp:35121:81"/>there be any thing Divine in Diſeaſes, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fore-ſight alſo of That is to be ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if a Man would approve himſelf a good and admirable Phyſician.</hi> But what that <hi>Divine</hi> Thing was, he no where clearly diſcovered, nay, he Studiouſly and of purpoſe concealed it, expreſly affirming, that nothing ought to be ſpoken or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in this Art, ſave what was known to <hi>Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> On which account, <hi>Phyſick</hi> was heretofore eſteemed <hi>Sacred,</hi> and the gift of God, ſo that all the Ancients were of opinion, that It could hardly be attained unto by Humane Underſtandings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Foundations thereof ſeemed ſo abſtruſe, hidden, and admirable, that They were not to be found out by the ſtrength of Nature; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, heretofore, and in all Ages, Men of great account for acuteneſs of Wit, and Skill in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> have Illuſtrated Its Doctrine, yet there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extant in their Writings in clear and expreſs words, neither can any thing be culled out from thence, but what is ſullied with Obſcurity: They all endeavouring as much as they could, more to eclipſe and darken It: <hi>Neoterick Phyſicians</hi> who ſucceeded them, in Writing, Diſputing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to encreaſe this Art, have falne to pieces amongſt themſelves, and contemning that <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> thing in Diſeaſes, rail at one another, and are divided into ſeveral Sects; neither doth the Diviſion ceaſe to this very day: For one deſires to be ſtyled a <hi>Chymiſt</hi> or <hi>Methodiſt,</hi> another a <hi>Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt,</hi> a third a <hi>Dogmatiſt</hi> or <hi>Canoniſt,</hi> ſo that this moſt Noble Ancient Hippocratical Medicine, which is but One, is now, not only rent into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sects, but is alſo overcharged with an infinite number of Books, by which a lover of, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer
<pb facs="tcp:35121:81"/>after Truth, is not only confounded, but muſt needs be over-whelmed: There being ſuch a vaſt Ocean of Them, and ſo great a variety of Writers, ſubtilly ſpinning out their Arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, I was always of opinion that That before-mentioned ſhort Sentence of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> was to be deeply weighed, and the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that Famous Man, whom Antiquity did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt reverence as a Deity, comprehended that great Supellex and Furniture of Things which he had in his mind, in ſhort and conciſe Aphoriſmes and Speeches. Excited therefore by my reſpect and love to Him, I began to Inveſtigate what that <hi>Divine</hi> thing was; for without the Plenary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of It, the Art of Cureing Diſeaſes would always be Mutilous, and only Inchoative, never fully and abſolutely compleat in all its parts.</p>
                  <p>Some there are who do accuſe thoſe men of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, and do alſo Contumeliouſly reproach them, who do their utmoſt to reſtore and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop Sciences (delivered indeed by the Ancients, but now almoſt worn out by age, and Adultera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beſides) or elſe who do endeavour to add to them, or illuſtrate them: moreover they labour to Degrade ſuch perſons from the firſt Knowledge of things, and ſo to diſ-inherit them from their poſſeſſion of ancient Learning; by whoſe Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the Enquirers after Truth, are deterred and led out of the right way.</p>
                  <p>If the ancient Philoſophers had taken this courſe to reproach the Labours and Studies of Thoſe that went before them, they had never pierced into the inward knowledge of Nature, but the Truth in many Sciences would as yet have been buryed
<pb facs="tcp:35121:82"/>in Obſcurity, and very few would have attained to any light in the Secrets of Nature.</p>
                  <p>But ſince Thoſe Philoſophers were pleaſed with another way and manner of Study, not being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred or taken off from their honeſt Labour by the tongues of Revilers, but rather more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applying themſelves to their Diſquiſitions and Studies; ſo that almoſt in every age, ſome one or other Art and Science was hatched or elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieved, and from ſmall beginnings, promoted to great encreaſe.</p>
                  <p>Semblably, why may not I more clearly open the ſenſe of <hi>Hippocrates?</hi> That ſo the Ancient and Noble Science of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> and Method of <hi>Cures</hi> may receive an advancement? why may it not be lawful for me to Contemplate that <hi>divine,</hi> abſtruſe and admirable Thing, as well in Diſeaſes as Remedies? and to reſtore It from Darkneſs to Light? Let the Tongues of Slanderers be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, let them not blame me, that being but a Puny, I firſt of all bear the Lamp to all that ſeek for Truth, in this Argument. Let all ſuch Flies and Cantharides be packing, for as the One pitches on the ſlouriſhing Corn, and the Other fly into the ſweeteſt Oyntments; ſo theſe fooliſh and ſloathful Calumniators ceaſe not to detract from the labours and manners of other men, perſwading themſelves that they ſhall catch much Honour and Glory, by fiſhing for it in the diſgracing of others.</p>
                  <p>Avaunt ſuch Thorny Medickes; Let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually go a begging, and ſpend their time in collecting raw Receits, reformed neither by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Method, nor Judgement; which, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> diſapproves and proſcribes in the very entrance
<pb facs="tcp:35121:82"/>into this Art, as unſafe, becauſe not underſtood. <hi>Experiment,</hi> ſays he upon this account, <hi>is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious:</hi> Neither let them Object to me, this my <hi>Institution,</hi> as a new and unprofitable piece, whereas indeed It is moſt Ancient, and found moſt true by ſolid Experience, not that I am ſo vain and inſolent, as to boaſt my ſelf to be the <hi>Author</hi> of It, I only profeſs my ſelf to be its Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Explainer.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I determined to do in a Book by it ſelf, and therefore I pre-emitted my <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> which Book ſeem ed neceſſary for the demonſtration of the Subſequent Doctrine by known Examples. But now, ſeeing Malign Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance raigns in Our Art, I think it better to change my Reſolution, and to reduce into this <hi>Compendium,</hi> what and how much of <hi>Divinity</hi> is in Ancient Medicine, as alſo in Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and in all things; All which ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, for the ſake of the Prudent, in this Little Book.</p>
                  <p>I determined, Mighty Prince, and my graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, to Dedicate this my grand Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to You, not with an intent to Blazon the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of Yours and Your Anceſtors moſt Auguſt Houſe, that be far from me, for I know that all Adulation doth diſpleaſe Your Highneſs; but becauſe You are a Favourer of hidden Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and of all admirable Things, and eſpecially a Patron of the Muſes: which evidently appears, not only by that flouriſhing Academy which you have lately erected, but furthermore by thoſe great Largeſſes and Stipends, wherewith you have endowed its choice Members, and learned Profeſſors, out of Your incredible Clemency and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.
<pb facs="tcp:35121:83"/>To which may be added Your Highneſſes ſingular Courteſy, Bounty, and Benevolence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended towards Me in particular, your poor Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the laſt year; and alſo that unſpeakable Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, which Your Father, of happy Memory, a few years ſince, ſhewed towards me, which you by a rare Example have alſo doubled and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done: Which conſideration alone had been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to have obliged me to make this Dedication to Your Self, and ſo to hang up this little Table on the publick Altar of Immortality, not only that my Writings may hereby ſpeak to the whole World, but that I might manifeſt the ſymbol of a grateful mind, and might teſtify and profeſs my obſervance of You.</p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed therefore, <hi>Great Sir,</hi> favourably to accept of that admired <hi>Divine</hi> Thing of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> anciently adorned with ſomany Trophies, now conſecrated to Your <hi>Mighty Name,</hi> and let it find a place there, whither the Meſſengers of a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mind are wont to be admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                  </head>
                  <p>IN the Inquiſt after the hidden Cauſes of Things, how prone Men are to erre and to be miſtaken, without the help of True Experiments, it eaſily appears by that common, and in this age, Epidemical Complaint (which I my ſelf do alſo think not altogether groundleſs) concerning the inconſiderate edition and multitude of New Books; partly, beeauſe the raſh publication of the Writings of Scioliſts and vain Perſons, is of it ſelf odious, partly alſo, becauſe ſuch a multiplicity of raw Pamphlets doth prejudice even our common Scanties, and takes off the minds of many from Reading the Books of the Ancients, which are full fraught with accurate Wiſdom and Inſtruction: whence probably it may come to paſs, that the Studies of the Ancients, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after Truth, may be leſs eſteemed and regarded by us. And if any one demand, why do I then publiſh this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Tract? A piece Compoſed with no Maturity of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but thruſt forth in great haſte and temerity; and conſequently, in no wiſe to be compared, in point of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, with the Mouuments of the Ancients. To him I anſwer, There are two Cauſes, which moved me again to put Pen to Paper, and to emit to publick view this <hi>Piece</hi> of Ancient Medicine, Firſt, in the Year <hi>1666,</hi> I Printed the neceſſary Opinions of the Old Philoſophers, under the Title of <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> and there ſhewed by clear Arguments deduced from Exerience, p that <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:35121:84"/>in eſſence, root, and property, ought to be eſteemed the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mordial Principles of all Things (ſince the Divine Old Man <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his firſt Book of <hi>Diaet</hi> treats of the ſame, after the manner of the <hi>Pythagoreans,</hi> wittily enough, yet moſt obſcurely, perhaps fearing the ridiculous cenſure and inept confutation of ſuch as the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> and <hi>Norinberg</hi> Doctors of Phyſick, and their foul mouthed companions, who are craftily buſied with their Ruſtick Muſe, only about the barks and outſide of things) becauſe in finding out the ſecret and hidden Cauſes of things, <hi>Theſe</hi> appear to be more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, then all probable Conjectures and Vulgnr Placits of Philoſophers; and I did it, for no other end and purpoſe, but out of a deſire to know the Truth, which every honeſt man ſhould cordially embrace; ſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> Teaches in the firſt Book of his <hi>Ethickes, Chap. 4. It is better, ſays he, yea, it is our Duty, ſo Truth may be ſecured, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and cancel our own Opinions and Decrees.</hi> Now whoſoever ſhall Read and rightly <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand the Books of the Ancients, will unden ably confeſs, that I have as well in my <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> as in this <hi>little Book,</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Truth, and that I have diſcovered Natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Rare Myſteries in a clear Vein of Speech.</p>
                  <p>In demonſtrating of theſe things, I have obſerved the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Geometricians, who from the leaſt <hi>point</hi> and moſt eaſy foundations, do gradually aſcend to matters moſt great and difficult, by which an ingenious mind at length climbs even above the Stars: So alſo, The Ancient Hippocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicine and the Method of my Science, in a convenient order, firſt, ſhew things leſs rare, yea, things moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, and aſcending from them by degrees, It ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits things more choice and excellent. So <hi>Hermes</hi> from an Egg, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> from Arts, <hi>Morienus</hi> from a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Baſilius</hi> from Ale, <hi>Coſmopolita</hi> from Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at length in an admirable manner; as well in the Great as Leſs World (for there is the ſame Reaſon in both) have unlocked the Cloſets and Secrets of Nature, that ſo the Principles, Reaſons, and Cauſes of Things may be clearly ſeen, as it were in a Looking-glaſs.</p>
                  <p>By this my private, plain, and ſafe method, many Learned Men (whom I ſhall not name for fear of expoſing them to
<pb facs="tcp:35121:84"/>the ridiculous Cenſure of the Deans and their Fellows) being addicted to the Study of this Ancient Philoſophy, have confeſſed that they have reaped much benefit; for in this my way, they have found that ſaying of <hi>Pythagoras, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is in every thing alike,</hi> to carry with it not a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit and diſguiſed, but a ſincere and infallible Truth.</p>
                  <p>But ſince it is an old Calamity amongſt Men, that Vertue is always oppreſſed by violence, but Vice and Falſhood, like froth and ſcum, ſwims a-top in the impure pot of this World; ſo alſo ſome have endeavoured to defame my <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates Chymicus,</hi> which is ſupported by Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Experience and Reaſon, and to diſpoil it of its Vertue and Truth, by mutilating words, and perverting Sentences; that ſo they might not only caſt dirt in the Face of Ancient Medicine, but alſo be found falſaries and committers of the crime of Defamation againſt Law and Right.</p>
                  <p>To prevent this wile, and to apply ſome remedy to this crafty machination, it was altogether neceſſary for me to meditate and reſolve upon a new Edition of the Ancient Truth; for I began to think with my ſelf, that Young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents might reap much more benefit from my Doctrine, if what had been maliciouſly changed, perverted and caſtrated, might come forth more entire and corrected; ſo that this is the ſecond cauſe why I again ſet forth this part of <hi>Ancient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,</hi> which I have Adorned and Confirmed with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Experiments and Reaſons, drawn from the Ancient Fountains of Nature; And I have moreover ſo clearly explained the cauſes of things, that for the future no man in his right wits can reaſonably impugne my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Foundations of the Truth. So that Students, who love the Truth (of whom I hope there are many) may be much aſſiſted by this <hi>Iſagoge</hi> and Manuduction.</p>
                  <p>There is no doubt but virulent envy, the inſeparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of Vertue, will object it to me as a crime (as it did heretofore, firſt, becauſe I ſhewed the ſincere way of ſublimating of <hi>Mercury;</hi> which Calumny was heard by me not without laughter, but that offence is to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to ſuch Jejune Interpreters of Nature, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to be hoped for: and ſecondly, becauſe in the <hi>28
<pb facs="tcp:35121:85"/>Chapter</hi> of my <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> I taught the way of conglutinating Gold and Iron) I ſay, it will be imputed to me that I now diſcover and bring to light, things hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſecret and concealed. But do you not, for this, raſhly, and without throughly weighing my cauſe, condemn the guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, for it becomes a Judge to hear the Reaſons on both ſides of the Parties, betwixt whom he is to give Sentence: If it ſeem a fault that I have exhibited the Truth of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocratical Medicine,</hi> hitherto unknown to all of you, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly before you, yet be not preſently enraged, nor caſt forth reproachful ſpeeches againſt me, but firſt of all conſider, whether it having been ſullyed with falſe receits and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, comes not now forth, nearer to the clear Truth, then remoter from it? and next, whether its luſtre be not more encreaſed than diminiſhed? By means whereof, perhaps in a fitter ſeaſon, <hi>ſhe her ſelf</hi> will give thanks to her Foſterers and Refiners, neither will <hi>ſhe</hi> deny them <hi>her</hi> Patronage againſt the Crafts and Frauds of Impoſtors, nor with-draw her defence from <hi>them</hi> againſt the fierce darts of ignorance, leaſt the former, like wild beaſts, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying at another mans good, and the latter enraged and hood-winked by it own blindneſs, ſhould any longer contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliouſly and petulantly break in upon the pleaſant Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and promiſing Crop of this Ancient Hippocratical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; and ſo tread down and lay waſte the praiſe-worthy Labours of ſuch Wiſe Men as have gone before us.</p>
                  <p>Tis in vain for them to terrify me with their bug-bears, I ſcorn all their endeavours; for I have choſen Truth for my faithful and powerful <hi>Protectreſs,</hi> which ſhall now come forth and appear in open view, not as fools do in licentiouſneſs of revenge, repelling force by force, but with the rod of reaſon and modeſty, it ſhall ſmite and ſcourge ſuch fooliſh detractors, that they may repent of their ſimplicity and folly, and hereafter be aſhamed to ſnarle at, or bite this <hi>Ancient Hypocratical Medicine</hi> with their livid and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure mouths and teeth. It is thy part, Courteous Reader, to ſtop the mouths of ſuch Barretors, furiouſly railing againſt me, and to bridle their lying and reproachful tongues, leſt they ſhould glory in their own wickedneſs, and all the day long their heart ſhould meditate unrighteouſneſs, and their
<pb facs="tcp:35121:85"/>tongue deviſe miſchief, like a ſharp Razor, and love evil more than good, and ſo raſhly accuſe and condemn others, according to the Pſalmiſts words. But how eaſily their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ſtupidity and ignorance may be, and is, obviated by me, by means of this <hi>Ancient Hippocratical Medicine,</hi> there are no better witneſſes then thoſe Noble and Worthy Perſons amongſt whom I live, and am daily converſant with. And as the Rock breaks and repels the ſurging waves which aſſault it (it ſelf, remaining unmoveable) ſo it becomes me patiently to hear, and at the ſame time to contemn and diſpiſe the reproaches and non-ſenſical objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of unskilful ones, without any perturbation of mind, and without any bitterneſs and wrath.</p>
                  <p>For on the 28th day of <hi>Auguſt, 1668,</hi> having received a Book, though Licenſed and Approved, yet full of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſneſs and folly; a few days after (my health requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it) I went on a ſudden to <hi>Millaine,</hi> to that Illuſtrious Perſon, The Lord Marqueſs <hi>Fiorenza,</hi> a Noble Senator of that City, and I compleated <hi>this Hippocratical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> in my Chariot on the way; yea, I had publiſhed it compleat, before the laſt of the Calends of <hi>November,</hi> the ſame year (I mean as compleat as the nature of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument required) unleſs the cenſure of the Inquiſitors had retarded my purpoſe; which I think fit, gentle Reader, to acquaint thee with. Favour me therefore, if thou art in thy right mind, and remember <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Advice, which is, not to divulge or make known any thing, but what is within the Ken and Cognizance of Ruſticks and Plebei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Hippocrates</hi> reduces all theſe three Cauſes into two neceſſary and ſufficient Principles, calling them <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Water: Raimund</hi> calls them <hi>Entia Realia;</hi>

                        <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female,</hi> &amp;c. But I, for the clearer knowledge and explanation of them, do call thoſe two Principles of <hi>Hippocrates, Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcaly,</hi> becauſe all things in the Univerſe are made up of thoſe two Univerſal Principles, as I ſhall gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhew by Experience, (ſo is alſo, <hi>that one only</hi> Medicine or Phyſick of the Ancients) To which yet a third doth Inſeparably adhere: Hence aroſe <hi>Sal, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Three Principles of ſome Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and rightly to, as will more clearly appear in the progreſs. Theſe two, either perpetually burn in Love one towards another, or elſe are at perpetual va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, are multiplied, and one is contrary to the other; ſo that the death of one is the life of the other, and that which one produces another deſtroys; that ſo from this another more noble thing may again ariſe.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> with good Reaſon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, That theſe two Elements <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcaly,</hi> can do all things, and that all things are in them. From the <hi>Acid</hi> do proceed two Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Qualities, to wit, <hi>Hot</hi> and <hi>Dry,</hi> from the <hi>Alcaly,</hi> as many Female ones, <hi>viz. Cold</hi> and <hi>Moiſt,</hi> all flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth for the generation of mixed bodies, for which reaſon they do concur and are commixed. The two greater Lights do preſide over thoſe two as Principle Elements. <hi>The Sun,</hi> is the Author of the Fire of Nature, and <hi>the Moon,</hi> the Miſtris of Humids. <hi>Matter</hi> or Hyle is therefore called the <hi>Principle</hi> of all things, becauſe all things in an inviſible manner, are generated of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> From thoſe two is made up the innate <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid</hi> of all things, which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, is very much in them, as they increaſe; the matter will be moſt clear when we ſhall ſpeake not only to the ears, but to the eyes alſo.</p>

                     <p>MY <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> in the 10th and 18th Chapter, ſhews in Wine and Tartar, that the <hi>Fire</hi> of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the formal Principle of things, can be ſeparated by no Analy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Deſtruction, nor by any Ingenuity of Art.

                        <note place="margin">The Son of Fire</note> as appears by <hi>Bernard de Treſne</hi> in his third part, who calls <hi>Gold</hi> moſt

                     <p>And as the Sun in the Firmament of Heaven, is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Wiſe Men, to be incorruptible, conſtant, and perpetual, and by its Author is endewed with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Embelliſhments, that Himſelf is ſaid to have placed his <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in it; for which cauſe it is called the <hi>Form of Forms,</hi> or <hi>the Acid of Acids</hi> (though it be not acknowledged for ſuch by the Vulgar, as neither is Gold) or the <hi>

                     <p>So alſo Gold, being the Off-ſpring of the Heavenly Sun, is incorruptible, conſtant, and perpetual, of an entire Form, or a perfect Acid, and fixed, though, as I ſaid before, it be not owned as ſuch by the ignorant Vulgar: For unleſs it were a fixed <hi>Acid,</hi>

                        </note> now unleſs Gold were Occultly <hi>Acid</hi> and pinguous. as common <hi>Sulphur</hi> is, it would never corrode Iron.

The manner how this is to be done, is laid down in <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> Chap. 7. (for thoſe things which have been ſpoken elſewhere, and rightly by others, I will not unneceſſarily repeat;) ſo that Gold, unleſs it were <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Pinguous,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gold is Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</note> as common <hi>Sulphur</hi> is, would never perform Sulphurous Actions with <hi>Nitre,</hi> as common <hi>Sulphur</hi> doth, with the ſame <hi>Nitre</hi> for Gunpowder.</p>
                     <p>If then the Sun, according to <hi>Hormes,</hi> be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Vital Spirit, which dwells in the Air, and Gold and Fire are its Brethren, the <hi>Sons</hi> muſt neceſſarily partake of the quality,<note place="margin">Fire Acid.</note> diſpoſitions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the <hi>Paren<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t;</hi> ſo that it muſt needs follow by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35121:89"/>Reaſon and Authority (Experience alſo a ſtipulating thereunto) that the Vital Spirit of ours, the Child of the Sun, as alſo Gold and Fire are Acid and Pingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; wherefore Acid and Pinguous is a moſt Ancient Principle, the Life and Fountain of all things: Writers give It ſeveral Names, as Fire, Sun, Gold, Spirit, Sulphur, Form, Humid, Calid, Dry, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Appellations, all which are Synonymous, ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame thing, but in different reſpects diverſifyed into ſeveral Names: But I both here and elſwhere, call it <hi>Acid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Acid</hi> doth occultly lurk in all Seeds, becauſe of its ſelf it is a moſt peaceable and quiet thing, in regard Nature hath implanted more of <hi>Alcaly</hi> than of <hi>Acid</hi> in every <hi>Compoſitum</hi> (except Sulphurs) and therefore it moves not unleſs it be excited, as we ſee plainly in Dough of Bread; which being excited by a very little Acid Ferment, and by Heat, is mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and from that Heat and Motion the Acid is mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied; and unleſs it were bridled and reſtrained by a heat, exceeding the inward <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by Artificial Fire, it would proceed to Vitality and produce Worms. Hence it appears, That <hi>Natural</hi> Fire, is quite another thing then <hi>Artificial;</hi> and that theſe Two differ much from one another:<note place="margin">Natural Fire Acid.</note> for the Natural or Soft Fire, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (as I have ſhewed in Dough) doth Impregnate, Cheriſh, Infuſe Strength, and doth ſemblably perform all things in its <hi>Leſſer World,</hi> which the Sun, its Parent, doth in the <hi>Greater World:</hi> Hence we may obſerve,<note place="margin">A <hi>Microcoſme</hi> what.</note> That the proud Name of <hi>Microcoſme,</hi> doth not belong onely to <hi>Man,</hi> for every Seed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Worm, every Member, ſays <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> hath its Ventricle, and may be therefore called a <hi>Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſme.</hi> But <hi>Artificial</hi> Fire is an enemy to all Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, it lives upon Prey and Rapine, it fubfiſts by others Ruins, being the Deſtroyer of Life, and Enemy of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore from the Sun, as from a Fountain, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Acid, and Vital Light do flow forth; which, in reality are both one, only diſtinguiſhed by their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35121:89"/>for it is the Office of the <hi>Acid,</hi> to pierce into the inwards of Nature, whereas <hi>Light</hi> doth only diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the externals of things however the Beams of the Sun do operate both: So that the Sun is the firſt Natural Organ, by whoſe Acceſs and Receſs all the Operations of Nature are variouſly governed, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and remitted. Hence the Ingenious <hi>Coſmopolita, If there were not a Vegetable power in Sulphur</hi> (that is a Pinguous Acid, and Child of the Sun) <hi>Water would never be Coagulated into Herbs.</hi> If therefore the Acid, flowing from the Sun, be infuſed into Matter (as for Example, <hi>Mineral</hi>) preſently it receives the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Nature and the Vertue of the <hi>Mineral.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like may be ſaid of other Animals and Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles too, as <hi>Lully</hi> ſpeaks; and becauſe this Natural A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidity is coupled with all Matter in the World, it hath therefore the Name of <hi>Mercury</hi> given it by the Wiſe. And though the Eyes of the Vulgar do daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this multiplication, and alſo incorporation of the Natural Acid; yet they do not underſtandingly conſider it.

                     </p>

                     <p>As concerning the Ignorant, either Allowers or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors, who write without any ſure foundation, I am not ſolicitous about them; for I know that Calumny (which is not in a Man's own power to avoid) leaves a guilt on him that caſts it; He, againſt whom it is directed, being innocent and faultleſs: Nay, nothing is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to an Honeſt-man, then to undergo Reproaches for love of Vertue; for it is undergone in this caſe, with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Pleaſure and Alacrity, and being never long-lived, It again returns of its own accord without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to its Author: But to return,</p>

                     <p> So, That nouriſhing <hi>Alcaly</hi> is made out of Water,<note place="margin">Alcaly in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> 
                        <hi>Paracelſus</hi> proves by the accretion of a Flint in a Phyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs; for <hi>water</hi> is the Liquor and Root of all things, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> witneſſeth in his Books of Diet: <hi>Fire,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Water doth Nouriſh.</note> ſays he, <hi>moves all things, but Water nouriſhes all things.</hi> Hence <hi>Lactantius, Water is all things: Democritus</hi> alſo was not ignorant of the Vertues of Water, who therefore affirmed that Truth was hid or immerſed in a Well: So <hi>Hermes, Water is ſuſceptible and producible of Nutriment in Men and other things, and without Water, Nature operates not:</hi> See <hi>Hippoc. Chym. chap.</hi> 19.</p>
                     <p>For confirmation of my Aſſertion, let us hear the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Coſmopolita; Nature,</hi> ſays he, <hi>knows how to produce fruits in the Earth, out of Water, and from the Air to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them with life:</hi> Which is as much as to ſay, unleſs lus ſifter <hi>(i. e.)

                     <p>Hence it is that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> again ſays, <hi>De Naturâ pueri:</hi> many things do happen out of a few, becauſe all things produced on the Earth, do Extract a more copious ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue from the Earth, than they brought with them from their Parents or Originals: 'Tis the ſame thing which <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>So that Common Water is that Catholick and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Wine, which Animals,<note place="margin">A Catholick Wine.</note> Vegetables and Minerals do drink, each of them after their own peculiar manner.
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35121:92"/>And therefore to deny that <hi>Alcaly</hi> is in Water, is to fight againſt the graveſt Authors, againſt Reaſon, and againſt Experience. And they which in like ſort deny Water to nouriſh, gain nothing but univerſal Scorn for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; but let us hear <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaking in his Firſt Book of Diet, againſt thoſe who deny water to Nouriſh, and to be Coagulated by the vertue of <hi>Sulphur</hi> into Minerals, Vegetables, and Animals, yea into Humane Bodies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſeeing Nature acts every where alike. <hi>In thoſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>where Fire is overcome by the preſence of Water, ſome call ſuch perſons Sottiſh, others Amazed Ones, Stupids or Dolts; which Temper is a certain duller ſpecies of Madneſs: Such perſons do Weep and Wail, when no man troubles or ſtrikes them; they fear things not to be feared, and are ſadned at things not at all belonging to them, and do imagine ſuch things as Wiſemen would never do.</hi>

                        <hi>Wherefore it is good to Purge ſuch troubled Brains with</hi> Hellebore, <hi>provided</hi> Anticyra <hi>have enough to do the Feat:</hi> Thus ſpeaks <hi>Hippocrates</hi> againſt thoſe who deny that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doth Nouriſh.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto I have demonſtrated out of the Shop of Wiſe Nature, how the <hi>Child of the Sun,</hi> being Reverberated by the Sun-beams, is fixed into <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and how That <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> doth again inceſſantly Attract the <hi>Child of the</hi> Sun, and ſo they are both condenſed together. To this Natural Operation, I will now ſubjoyn That which is Artificial, that it may appear how Venerable Antiquity did endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to imjtate Nature as near as was poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Art therefore takes Vegetables of all ſorts, Wood, Shrubs, Chips, Loppings, Leaves, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all green and freſh (whoſe moiſture here is inſtead of Rain:) if it be Wood, young Shrubs, or Loppings, which are made uſe of, They may be burnt in the open Air, or in a Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and ſo without flaming out, be reduced to Aſhes, leſt that which we ſeek for, ſhould return by the motion into Air, or its own Country. If they be Herbs full of Juice, they may be burnt to Aſhes in a fired and lighted furnace (Fire here is inſtead of the Sun Beams, which reverberates the Acid of Vegetables into Alcaly) which, afterwards are agitated with a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35121:92"/>quick flame in a reverberating Furnace, fit for this purpoſe, till they begin to threaten fuſion; a ſure Argument that the Acid is ſhut up in the Alcaly, and then they are called <hi>Alcalizate or Pot-aſhes;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Artificial Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> out of theſe Aſhes, by means of Common Water Salt, is elicited by Lixivation; then the Water is exhaled, till the Siccity remains, which is called, <hi>Fixed Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Sal Alcaly:</hi> This Salt, having almoſt loſt its form, remains for the greateſt part a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> and therefore being impatient of inanition, it again deſires to be ſaturated with the Acid into Salt, that it may fulfil the courſe of Nature; as I have ſhewed before out of <hi>Coſmopolita.</hi> And as Nature doth inceſſantly and daily infuſe an Occult Vital Acid out of the Air into the Alcaly made by her, both of which do afterwards (the heat of the Sun concocting them) gradually riſe up into Corn and Fruit; ſo alſo, Art,<note place="margin">Alcaly with Oyl is made Sope.</note> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, doth impregnate her prepared Alcaly, leſt it ſhould wax barren, with an Occult Acid; an for Example, Oyl, Fatneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by a continual heat doth by little and little digeſt them, till it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurge into Sope of a Salt taſte; or elſe it mixes it with things more fixed, either White Sand, or Powder of Flints; which mixture, being agitated in a ſtronger Fire (<hi>viz.</hi> of Fuſion) riſes up to Glaſs,<note place="margin">Alcaly with Flint is made Glaſs.</note> which muſt needs be of a Salt taſte, becauſe it is made of the Acid of Flint and Fixed Alcaly; yea, Alcaly ſaturated with ſo much Acid, as to make it ſufficient for it ſelf, is turned into <hi>Salt;</hi> and if the Alcaly be not ſaturated with Acid enough to diſſolve or ſlack the Flint, then the Alcaly overcomes the Acid, and the Glaſs attracts Humidity from the Air, by means of the empty and thirſty Alcaly, and ſo chinks and is broken. Hence <hi>Zoar</hi> ſays, That <hi>Glaſs</hi> may be made out of any Herb, <hi>viz.</hi> when it is Alcalized, as my <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhews, Chap. 4th. and 5th.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being underſtood; we are again fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Arguments againſt Thoſe who deny,<note place="margin">Fix'd Acid.</note> That there is a Fixed <hi>Acid</hi> in Nature; and as, when the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly</hi> exceeds the <hi>Acid,</hi> the Glaſs chinks, and contracts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35121:93"/>flaws, ſo becoming uſeleſs; ſo alſo (as I have ſhewed above out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) thoſe perſons in whoſe Brains Water exceeds the Fire, do become ſo ſtupid and dull, that by reaſon of their darkning humidity, they can perceive no Fixed <hi>Acid</hi> in Nature.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Glaſs</hi> is deſtroyed by the ſame Fixed <hi>Alcaly</hi> of which it is compounded and made;<note place="margin">Deſtruction of Glaſs.</note> a Poſition contrary to Thoſe who deny, <hi>That there is no</hi> Alcaly <hi>like to</hi> Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; then which, nothing can be ſpoken more abſurd.</p>
                     <p>But tis no wonder, If ſlight Doctors produce light Argumenrs. Therefore let more parts of <hi>Alcaly</hi> than of Glaſs be melted together into one lump,<note place="margin">Glaſs made Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</note> which, being expoſed to the Air, is wholly reſolved into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; <hi>for out of what Glaſs is made, into That, and by That, it must needs again be reſolved;</hi> as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rightly Teaches. Pour <hi>Mineral Acid</hi> drop by drop on this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, until the hiſſing noiſe ceaſe, and the <hi>Alcaly</hi> be ſaturated into a Salt taſte or ſapor, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Flints ſinks to the bottom. Such Endimions, who think themſelves never ſecure, ſometimes think that this powder, taken by the Mouth, doth generate Milk; and ſometimes they imagine it, though taken the ſame way, to be a very pernicious thing.</p>
                     <p>Our Anceſtors tell us the way of making this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>viz.</hi> That Red hot Glaſs ſhould be quenched in the Aſhes of Bean Stalks; which ſpeech, though it be not improper, yet it is laughed at by the <hi>enſlaved and mancipated rout;</hi> becauſe they do not firſt teach how to make a Lie for the quenching or extinction of Glaſs: as if <hi>Rhaſis</hi> had not expreſly taught us, That the Sayings and Writings of Philoſophers are always to be underſtood according to the poſſibility of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not according to the ſimple ſound of the Words; for to take notice of every minute thing, to ſuch as are Skilful in an Art, would be too long and tedious. Now the Word <hi>Quench,</hi> doth neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily preſuppoſe <hi>Liquor,</hi> as clearly appears out of <hi>Rhaſis:</hi> but my Anſwer is this, That the Sayings of Philoſophers are hardly underſtood by thoſe, who like vain perſons, ſeek for praiſe in Critical Gloſſes, having
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35121:93"/>been never enformed in the Operations of Nature, but have ſpent their time in collecting Receipts here and there, and Thoſe not well underſtood: And this may be the cauſe, why it is not given to Plebeians and Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſts, to diſtinguiſh Things; as will more clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hereafter.</p>
                     <p>After that Art in imitation of Nature, hath extracted Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly out of Vegetables, it preſently judges,<note place="margin">Flint is made Alcaly.</note> that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly muſt alſo neceſſarily lie hid in the Mineral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; eſpecially <hi>ſince Nature is alike in all things:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore It begins to burn and calcine Flints, with a naked Fire, until part of the Aliment be waſted (as it did in the Family of Vegetables;) but not being able, by ſimple Water, to extract Alcaly out of them, when they are calcined, becauſe the Fixed Acid periſhed not in the calcination, but again apprehended or catch'd hold of its Siſter, <hi>viz.</hi> Fixed Alcaly; and ſo both of them were concreted into a rocky ſubſtance: therefore ſhe begins to mingle Lime with three parts of the Alcaly of Vegetables, that ſo the Acid of the Flint,<note place="margin">Alcaly of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd Flint.</note> with two parts of Alcaly, might aſſume a Neutral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by the help of the third part of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Alcaly, one part of the Alcaly of Flint might be elicited; <hi>for like hath an eaſy ingreſs into like,</hi> as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> teaches, <hi>de locis in homine;</hi> and ſo, that moſt powerful Alcaly for making of Sope,<note place="margin">Alcaly for Sope.</note> hath been extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Family of Minerals, as is more largly declared in my <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> Chap. 3. and 4.</p>

                     <p>Let me now produce a Clauſe out of <hi>Botanicks,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Herb <hi>Kaly;</hi> for they call the Salt of this Herb <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and commend it for Vitrification; neither did I ever read that Sea-ſalt, or Pit-ſalt, were ever uſed for making of <hi>Glaſs</hi> or <hi>Sope;</hi> becauſe they have been found by experience to be ſaturated and impregnated with Acid, and not empty; ſo that, They can imbibe nothing, but their own proper Acid; yea, they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly let go or part with their own Acid: and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Alcaly did abſume in it ſelf the Fixed Acid part of the Flint, <hi>Glaſs</hi> could never be made; which is proved by the ſupernatant fatneſs, which is no longer Alcaly,<note place="margin">Fel Vitri.</note> but called <hi>Fel vitri,</hi> which is unfit for Vitrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for <hi>This</hi> being ſaturated with Fixed Acid, from the Flint; by reaſon of its Saltneſs, repreſents the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and appearance of Trencher Salt, and therefore is onely good to be given to Horſes and Cattel to ſharpen their Stomachs to their Fodder, where Salt is very
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35121:94"/>dear. And ſo, the Salts, which abſorb the Acid, are called <hi>Alcalys</hi> by the Ancient Philoſophers (and ſuch they are) to diſtinguiſh them from that common Trenchet Salt which we eat: In like manner, I ſhall alſo call them <hi>Alcalys,</hi> having Authority, Reaſon, and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on my ſide (let <hi>Momus's</hi> bark never ſo much; wherefore in a Flint, conſtant in the Fire, and fixed there dwells Alcaly and Acid, a <hi>Leſſon,</hi> which the <hi>Dean</hi> and their <hi>Fellows</hi> never yet Learned; but I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively ſhew that the Acid in the Flint is made <hi>Glaſs,</hi> and again, that out of the Alcaly of the ſame Flint is made <hi>Sope;</hi> and both thoſe Principles by Alcaly alone, are divided into two diverſe ſubſtances, very neceſſary for Humane uſe; and unleſs there were <hi>Hals</hi> and <hi>Cheo (i. e.)</hi> melting of Salt, whence <hi>Alchymy</hi> hath its name, men muſt neceſſarily want both <hi>Sope</hi> and <hi>Glaſs;</hi> ſee the Preface to my <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus.</hi>

If therefore <hi>Alcaly</hi> be vacuous, and <hi>Acid</hi> an imbiber, as I have ſhewed, How, and by what reaſon, can the Alcaly of Tartar be proclaimed to be purely Salt? and how can it be approved for ſuch? Surely ſo to affirm, is meerly a monſtrous thing, and an old Wives Tale, full of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ignorance; invented and approved only by ſhallow
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35121:95"/>heads, but exploded and derided by the intelligent and learned. Beware therefore, O ye lovers of Truth, of ſuch couzening Chapmen, the matter is far otherwiſe then thoſe boaſters do vain-gloriouſly pretend.

                     <p>The Praiſe and Renown of Trenchar-Salt is ſpread over the whole world;<note place="margin">Salt a known thing.</note> ſo that in Apologizing for it, I undertake as it were the defence of the Sun, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſwarm of Flies, endeavoring to ecclipſe its Light: Salt, becauſe it is ſo neceſſary an Element for Mortals, that Mans Life cannot be ſuſtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, therefore Nature exhibited it to us, brought to full perfection, and requires not from us (as in our other Acquiſt) any Uſtion, but only that we dry it from its aqueous Humidity; whether it be Sea Salt or Salt from Pits. Principles, equally poized, do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to its mixture, which is made in Natures Shop; ſo that venerable Antiquity hath determined, <hi>All Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Perfections to be in the Sun and Salt;</hi> and it is called by <hi>Helmont,</hi> and that on good ground, the <hi>Chief of Salts,</hi> and is the Armoniack amongſt them all; yet notwithſtanding it is praiſed from the Countrey, whence it comes, as <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> hath it: See <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates Chymicus,</hi> Chap. 2.</p>
                     <p>But the Fame of Alcaly hath not yet reached to all People,<note place="margin">Alcaly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to moſt.</note> becauſe Eſſentially and Corporally it appears not in Nature, unleſs it be made by Art and Uſtion, as well in the Animal as Vegetable and Mineral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35121:96"/>yet with this difference, that ſome Minerals, not equally mixed, contain more of Alcaly than Acid; Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Gold, and Meat-Salt being excepted, which have more of Acid, as I have ſhewed. Hence it is, that the Ancients have Writ, that this <hi>Virgin</hi> hath three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>viz.</hi> Nature, Fire, and the Philoſopher: but here we muſt Note, that no man by the art of Uſtion, in any one of Natures Kingdoms,<note place="margin">Artificial Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never Pure, or deſtitute of any Form.</note> can prepare any Alcaly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely Pure <hi>(i. e.)</hi> deprived of all mixture of the Acid whatſoever; he that ſeeks to do it, will loſe his labour. Whence <hi>Coſmopolita, Burn,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Sulphur from incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Sulphur, and from its Soul,</hi> whoſe Grain and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, indeed <hi>Mercury</hi> hath in it, as much as is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for it ſelf; but make, that it may be ſufficient for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things too.</p>
                     <p>Enough now hath been ſpoken for the convincing of Thoſe that deny the principles of this Ancient Art, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Mercury</hi> hath no Sulphur ſeparable from it: 'Tis altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vain, what ſome Maſters and Writers of Vanity have thought (ſays <hi>Geber</hi>) for I have ſeen that It doth emanate from it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Experience alſo confirms the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Common Salt is of a Salt-acid taſte <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Acid is prevalent in it, therefore it is incorruptible (if the Salt have loſt his ſavour, wherewith ſhall it be ſeaſoned?) Hence being moderately mixed with Meat, it conciliates a grateful taſte to them, and excites Appetite.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sal-Alcaly</hi> is contrary to a Salt-Acid taſte; hence if it be mixed, though but moderately, with Meats, it gives them an unſavory taſte, and blunts the Appetite.</p>
                     <p>Common Salt, by reaſon of its Acidity, preſerves Fleſh and Fiſh a long time from Putrfaction, and draws out and attracts from them the Volatile Alcaly, which by a Retort is again eaſily ſeparated, as <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Chap. 14.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary <hi>Sal-Alcaly</hi> doth conſume the Acid, and promotes Putrefaction. Common Salt doth imbibe nothing of Acid, and therefore being dryed from its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Humidity, and caſt into Butter of Antimony, it diſturbs it not; <hi>Sal Alcaly</hi> being dryed, and caſt into the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35121:97"/>fame Butter of Antimony, is ſo far from not diſturbing it, that in an inſtant it quite deſtrovs it; becauſe it drinks up the Acid Spirits, and the <hi>Antimony</hi> falls into a white Powder.</p>
                     <p>Common Salt being mixed with the Quadruple of <hi>Bole Armonick,</hi> and diſtilled with an open Fire, yields an Acid Liquor.</p>

For they do not underſtand the force and meaning of my words: Take this my Reduction of <hi>Alcaly of Tartar</hi> into <hi>Water,</hi> for an Example, they preſently, among the Unskilful, Vaunt This to be Volatile <hi>Alcaly;</hi> and do moreover commend it for a <hi>Cordial</hi> with their vain yet ſwelling words. By Theſe, and the like Fables, ſtudious Young-men are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, under pretence of Truth, becauſe they are Licenſed and Approved by the Lofty Magnifique <hi>Deans</hi> and Profeſſors of Phyſick: Innocent Youth is eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that Truth lyes in the bottom of ſuch Trifles, not knowing any more than their Maſters how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern Truth from Falſhood. But what effect ſuch and the like things can have in an Art, is manifeſt by daily Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; ſo that it is grown, and not without cauſe, a common Proverb, <hi>Mentiris ut Medicus:</hi> Which therefore of all the Philoſophers, would take pains to inſtruct ſuch an Indocile, Quarelſome, and Sluggiſh Rout? he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it without doing great Wrong to himſelf, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting an indelible ſtain of Infamy to his Credit.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35121:100"/>is the Foundation of the Ancient Phyſick; and although, all Receipts with their Exſcribers, Subſcribers, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers, were utterly loſt and periſhed, yet this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Science would remain unmoveable; whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation I have faithfully diſcovered in my <hi>Hippoc. Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus,</hi> by familiar and common Words and Examples; but ſuch putative and empty <hi>Doctors,</hi> by reaſon of the blindneſs of their minds, cannot reach to it (I call it blindneſs, ſeeing all Knowledge is Light, and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Darkneſs) as being long ſince excluded from the Knowledge of the Truth: Enough now concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this <hi>diſguiſed Elementary Water.</hi> There are many ſuch like trifles packed together in the fore-named <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſatory,</hi> which do not only caſt a blot upon Noble Phyſick, but do alſo redound to the Ruin of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; <hi>Things ill got, becauſe not underſtood, will be as badly ſpent.</hi> But theſe things requiring a Volume by themſelves, I ſhall forbear further ſpeaking of them at preſent, and return whence I digreſſed, Common Salt doth not waſh out filth, therefore Sope cannot be made of it. Hence it was, that <hi>Nauſicca</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King <hi>Alcinous,</hi> waſhed her Linnen out of a Fountain in the Sea-ſhore, as <hi>Homer</hi> notes, 6. <hi>Odyſſ.</hi> which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> rightly refers to the perfect mixture of this Salt, for ſeeing it hath no vacuity in it (as Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly hath) it can receive nho filth into it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sal Alcaly</hi> is vacuous, and by conſequence imbibes filth, and Sope is madeof it; becauſe it abſorbs the Occult Acid in the Oyl and Fat, which by a flow Concoction are converted together into Sope, of a Salt taſte, as my <hi>Hippoc. Chymicus</hi> hath it.</p>
                     <p>Common Salt fortifies and ſtrengthens living Fleſh, it cures the Scab, Mangy, and other Diſeaſes of the Skin, as the Sea-fiſhers can witneſs; yea being mixed with Oyl, it cures Scalds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sal Alcaly</hi> doth mortify and putreſy living Fleſh, as Potential Cauteries do witneſs; and the Hiſtory alſo ſhews, that it putreſyed a whole living Man in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it is mentioned in <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> Chap. 4.</p>

                     <p> Common Salt with Sand, paſſes not over into <hi>Glaſs,</hi> becauſe it is ſaturated with Acid.</p>
                     <p>Sal Alcaly, with Sand, it melted into Glaſs, becauſe being deſtitute of Acid, it receives into its Bowels the Acid of Flint, and by Fuſion, becomes of a Rocky Nature; as I ſhewed before.</p>
                     <p>Common Salt, makes Nitre impure, Sal Alcaly, cleanſes Nitre from all impurity, as my <hi>Hippoc. Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micus</hi> teaches, Chap. 8.</p>
                     <p>So we Read in <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> every Sacrifice ſhould be ſeaſoned with <hi>Salt,</hi> but no mention at all is made of <hi>Alcaly</hi> there.</p>
                     <p>So that it is manifeſt, from the Circumſtances a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, That Meat Salt, or Common Salt; the Child of the Sun, and the Chiefeſt of all Salts, differs very much from Inane and Vacuous <hi>Alcaly;</hi> which therefore I have ſet one againſt another, that it may appear to the Learned and Curious, that there is not a grain of Salt in thoſe great Bodies of Innovators, who contend, That Sal Alcaly is a <hi>Salſum,</hi> and ſo do igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly perſwade their unskilful followers: For there are no more Salts in the Univerſe, than Acid and Alcaly; Acids are infinite, all which have one only Alcaly for their foundation, in which they ſubſiſt, and are incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, as I ſhall Ocularly demonſtrate in the 6th. Chapter: So that all Salts, and all Things which are in the World, may, by an eaſy method, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Acid and Alcaly; therefore it will not be a miſs, yea pleaſant and acceptable, before I proceed, to ſubjoyn the Preparation of Medicinable Salts.</p>

Therefore, for the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Salts, our principle Care and Study ſhould be, That the Herbs be freſh (ſee Chap. 3.) for then, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cremation the innate Acid apprehends the Alcaly, and the Alcaly abſorbs, or ſucks up the Acid, and they are both fixed according to the property of the concrete; but from that part (which flies away with the flame,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35121:101"/>and, not being ſufficiently bound in by the Acid, goes to Soot) you may eaſily extract Volatile Alcaly.</p>
                     <p>Let Green Wormwood be the Example, Take This, green as it is, and burn it in a Chimney or open Place (but Fumitory, or ſuch like Juicy Herbs, may be caſt Green and Freſh, into a Red Hot Furnace, and the Mouth-hole be ſhut, that it catch its Flame:) flaming out is to be hindered as much as we can, for it is ſufficient that it be turned into Aſhes, though but black; which Aſhes are further to be Caloined in a large Earthen Pot, and low, or upon a large Iron Plate, of a lifted up edge; Coals being kindled under, in the Wind Furnace, to the end that the little Door may be opened or ſhut, as there is need: The Aſhes are always to be ſtirred with an Iron Spatule, till they be very white. Note that the proceſs made this way is and muſt be more Sweet and Benigne, than that mentioned, Chap. 3. in the Preparation of Alcaly; for There the Aſhes are ſtirred and agitated with a quick flame, which are therefore called, <hi>Clavellated,</hi> or <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſhes;</hi> but <hi>here</hi> the Fire muſt not touch the Aſhes, but they muſt be ſpread on a large Iron, or Earthen Plate, or Table, which muſt not enter the mouth of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace (ſee the Contents of my <hi>Hippoc. Chymicus,</hi> in the above-cited Chapter.) Lay the Aſhes on a Linnen Acumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Bag, or, if there be few of them, on Acuminated Paper, and pour Common Water on them, which, running through them, being pregnant with Salt, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> or Lye; Coagulate this ſtrained Lye, with a quick Ebullition, in a Frying Pan, not greaſed in the Kitchin, and make it up into a Maſs, which, when it begins to thicken like Honey, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually move with a <hi>Spatule,</hi> and it will be dryed up into a Grey Powder, which you muſt preſently lay in a Pot not Glazed, with a Cover, (the little Door of the Wind Furnace being ſtopped) and cover them with Small Coals, mixed with the Powder of the ſame Coals; leiſurely heat it, unto Brunity, not making it Red Hot, or melting it; when all is cooled, put the Salt into a Glaſs Veſſel, and diſſolve it in a ſufficient quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35121:102"/>of Water, ſtirring it between whiles, with a Wooden Stick, till the whole be diſſolved: afterwards let it reſt for two or three dayes, when it is clear, pour it forth from the Lees, without much ſtirring, and in a Leaden or Glaſs Veſſel placed in Sand, ſuffer the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to exhale without bubbles, till a Saline Cuticle ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: Then remove the Veſſel, and the next morning gather up the Splendent Grains of Salt, which are to be waſhed with clear Water, with a quick motion, and dryed; put the remaining Lye again into Sand, that the Water may exhale, as before, unto the Cuticle. Both theſe Salts are to be kept together joyntly in one Veſſel. It is to be obſerved, that <hi>Salts</hi> this way ſweetly prepared, do reſemble the <hi>Craſis</hi> of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, the reſt of the <hi>Lixivium</hi> being of an Urine-like taſte and ſtinking ſmell, is to be leſt for waſhing of Glaſſes. This is the eaſie and natural way to prepare Salts of Vegetables, which do never melt of themſelves, neither are of an ungrateful taſte; for they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of their proper Acid and Alcaly by Concre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: A pound of Theſe Aſhes yields almoſt four Ounces of the pureſt Salt, but four Pound of the Aſhes of dry Herbs will ſcarce afford one Ounce of Salt.</p>

Chapter, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Spirit of the World, or Child of the Sun, is Acid and Pinguous; and that this Pinguouſneſs or Sulphur doth participate of a third, which, as I have ſhewed in the ſaid firſt Chapter, doth inſeparably adhere to Fire and Water; which I will now more clearly demonſtrate in Vitriol, and in the Anatome thereof; wherefore it is vain, ignorant, and againſt all Truth, what they ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>viz,</hi> that Acids do not prevail over Alcalys, nor draw them hither and thither, as they pleaſe.</p>

(Here you muſt obſerve, that if both the Alcaly and the Acid were not firſt ſufficiently diluted, before their Conjunction, at their very firſt Meeting and Coalition, the White Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Vitriolated Tartar</hi> will fall, and there will be no Chryſtalline Grains produced:) Then remove the Veſſel from the heat, and ſet it in a cold place, and in the morning you ſhall find Shining Grains ariſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling the form of Vitriol, becauſe the Acid Spirit hath drawn the Alcaly to its own pleaſure <hi>(i. e.)</hi> into the form of Vitriol. This White Vitriol, they call <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolate

                     <p>The Occult Acid of Oyl, in the Alcaly, is regenerated into Pinguous Salt Sope.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Acid</hi> of <hi>Nitre</hi> in <hi>Alcaly,</hi> becomes True <hi>Nitre,</hi> conceiving Flame, and is a remedy for the Quinzey.

And when the ſame Natural Acid hath by chance corroded immature Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, then they are both coagualted into Vitriol of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; which, though mixed with Juice of Galls, grows not black; yet it is, and is alſo called both by the Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35121:108"/>he that boaſts he can do it, <hi>Coſmopolita</hi> proves him to be a <hi>Deceiver;</hi> ſo that every Spirit, either Occultly or Manifeſtly Acid, hath but one only <hi>Soul</hi> within it, with which, it being inſeparably joyned, doth conſtitute the Form of That Body, in which it determines to dwell; from which, wehn it is extracted, and again inſtilled upon a new Alcaly; and is abſorbed by it, it takes upon it the like Body, wherewith it was cloathed before, or from whence it was firſt extracted, but that Body ſomewhat clearer; an Infallible Argument, That a Spirit either Occultly or Manifeſtly Acid, is the Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Soul, and the Bond uniting Soul and Body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And unleſs the Spirit of all Things in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe were Acid, it could not inviſibly carry in its Belly or Womb the <hi>Aima</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> of the Body; as <hi>Hermes</hi> and Experience Teach.</p>

But it muſt needs be, that This Spirit can have no other Inſtruments but diſtilled Vinegar, ſince it can only make a Body of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar for it ſelf: Whence this Spirit hath been preſently known by Philoſophers,<note place="margin">Spirit of <hi>Venus</hi> which is as <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caheſt,</hi> is known to be Vinegar.</note> not for the Immortal Son of <hi>Venus,</hi> or as <hi>Alcaheſt,</hi> but for the True Genuine Brother of <hi>Vinegar of Wine;</hi> and that not Spurious neither, as my Revilers and Reproachers have publiſhed to the World, but the Legitimate Son of the Vine, which hereafter will count it an impious thing to be reviled by unskilful Maſters; Therefore in this regeneration, He was willing again to diſcover himſelf to the Curious, and to the Lovers of Truth, for the <hi>True and Natural Brother</hi> of Vinegar of Wine <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for Diſtilled Vinegar. Now that nothing may be wanting to this Enquiry, but all doubt taken away, <hi>viz.</hi> that This Spirit, which they dream to be the <hi>Child of Venus,</hi> hath acquired no Conſtancy, no Immortality, or excellent Vertues from the Copper, nor that it is, as <hi>Alcaheſt,</hi> as the Deans with their Fellows do cant, you may learn by this Experiment.

                     <p>But take that water ſo waſhed from the Corals, in which, as I have ſaid, the counterfeit Spirit of <hi>Venus,</hi> or ſome ſimple diſtilled Vinegar was diluted (if you have otherwiſe warily poured on the <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> for if you have careleſly, and without judgment powred on more than the Coral will imbibe, it will not ſwim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>top; but I ſuppoſe the affuſion was skilfully made) and inſtill into it Alcaly of Tartar, till the Motion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition ceaſe; exhale the abounding Water in a Glaſs Veſſel placed in Sand, and you ſhall find <hi>regenerated Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> as I have ſhewed above, from the Counterfeit Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Venus,</hi> or Vinegar, ſimply diſtilled, imbibed in Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly of Tartar, for it is the <hi>ſame,</hi> by this infallible Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, That in the Corals diſſolved and dryed in a Bath, there remained only half a Drachm of Acid Salt from the <hi>feigned Spirit of</hi> Venus. That Acid Salt being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Corals, by Spirit of Vitriol, cannot be alone;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35121:111"/>wherefore it guards it ſelf again in Elementary Water, as in his Mothers lap, and diffuſes it ſelf in her; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes again <hi>Counterfeit Spirit of Venus.</hi> And unleſs Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary water did contain Occult Alcaly in its belly, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Salt could not inhabit in it; becauſe that <hi>alone it is not ſufficient for it ſelf:</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath taught us, <hi>De Diaeta.</hi> Simple diſtilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> performes alſo the ſame thing; ſo that it now appears; even to the moſt unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful-in Phyſick, that this moſt celebrated <hi>Spirit of Venus,</hi> here and every where, is <hi>nothing</hi> elſe, and ſavours of <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi> elſe, but <hi>Diſtilled Vinegar,</hi> whatſoever Bugbears its Adorers would fright us with. And although <hi>Crollius, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinus,</hi> and other Writers of the Elements of <hi>Chymiſtry,</hi> in expreſs words do call it, <hi>Solvent Vinegar,</hi> from whom the proceſs of this <hi>Vinegar</hi> is ſtoln word for word, as my <hi>Hippoc.

Yet This poyſon of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance hath infected, not only <hi>Auſtria,</hi> but almoſt all upper <hi>Germany;</hi> witneſs theſe unskilful Approvers and their ſooliſh <hi>Partizans with their Rythmes.</hi> It would be no wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if, as the <hi>Romans</hi> of old, ſo Magiſtrates now, would eject out of their Cities and Common-wealths, ſuch Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotry Collegiates, and ſuch a Neſt of Bablers, who do ſcrible of things unknown, even to themſelves, to their Neighbours hurt. <hi>Low Germany</hi> is yet free from this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, ſo is <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and for the future, I hope by this Antidote they will be preſerved.</p>
                     <p>Now, Why <hi>Vinegar</hi> diſtilled from <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Vinegar from <hi>&amp; Eruga,</hi> why more Acid than Simple?</note> in a ſmall quantity, doth more powerfully diſſolve Corals, than That which is diſtilled the vulgar way? I have ſhewed the reaſon before, <hi>viz.</hi> that it happens, becauſe <hi>Vinegar</hi> diſtilled the common way, is as yet diluted with much Water; but the Elementary Water is evaporate from That, which is diſtilled from <hi>Aerugo,</hi> by gradual Exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, no otherwiſe than in the diſtillation of Green and Humid <hi>Vitriol,</hi> for then the Acid Salt being long in the Liquor, would be very weak; but when the <hi>humid</hi> (which they call <hi>Phlegm</hi>) hath by degrees exhaled and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated before diſtillation, the Acid Salt muſt needs be more powerful and ſtrong in a leſſer quantity of water; for Light by how much more contracted, by ſo much the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35121:112"/>more efficacious. This diſtilled Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain corrode any thing, either Iron, or Copper, and be coagulated with it, and again be re-diſtilled from it, the Liquor indeed returns Acid of the ſame nature, but much more ſubtle, becauſe that in all Coagulation, every Salt or Saline Spirit loſes of its <hi>Radical Humid</hi> (what that is, I ſhall ſhew anon) when of neceſſity it muſt lay down its <hi>Earth</hi> (the Vulgar call it its <hi>Faex</hi>) and ſo the <hi>Lumen</hi> muſt be more contracted. But from the repeated Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation and Diſtillation, It returns more watery; and at laſt returns to Elements; as I have Mechanically ſhewed in Alcaly of <hi>Tartar</hi> (for Example) in my <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> Chap. 10.</p>
                     <p>After the ſame manner and faſhion, <hi>Counterfeit Spirit of Venus,</hi> by repeated Solution, Coagulation, and Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, re-paſſes into Elements; for as often as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves Corals, or any other thing (I began with Corals and will end with Them) and is afterwards Coagulated and Exſiccated with the ſame Corals, ſo often it lays down its <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and as much Earth as it lays down, ſo much Acid Salt the Corals do drink up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>this cannot be alone,</hi> and the <hi>Vinegar</hi> becomes ſo much the more Aqueous, and by repeated labour, at laſt returns to Element <hi>(i. e.)</hi> into Inſipid Water; but the Earth and Acid Salt gave weight to the Corals, which alſo paſs out of them by repeated Diſtillation, and go to their own Country, after the ſame manner as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed concerning Wine in <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> chap. 18.</p>
                     <p>Now that <hi>Vinegar</hi> or Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> poured on Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,<note place="margin">Why Vinegar returns Acid from Copper, and not from Alcaly.</note> and re-diſtilled, do return Acid; but from the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly of <hi>Tartar,</hi> Inſipid and Aqueous, the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Alcaly being a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> ſaturated it ſelf with Acid Salt which dwelt in the Aqueous Liquor; whence the Acid Salt converts and tranſmutes the Alcaly into its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But Copper is not a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> for the <hi>Acid,</hi> or Form of Copper doth overcome its <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth not abſorb Acid Salts; and though they act, and are buſie about <hi>It,</hi> and do erode its body; yet they can make no impreſſion of any of their Form or Vertues, nor can they deſtroy It, becauſe Copper hath obtained a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35121:112"/>conſtant Soul from Nature, or to ſpeak in <hi>Plautus</hi>'s Phraſe it hath Acid in its breaſt.</p>
                     <p>Again,<note place="margin">Why from <hi>Lead</hi> inſipid?</note> They demand why <hi>Vinegar</hi> is re-diſtilled from Copper, even as it was poured on, but from Lead Inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid? Although I am almoſt aſhamed to handle This, or the like Childiſh Queſtion, yet being moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration towards thoſe unskilful and ſluggiſh Doctors, hoping that this my preſent anſwer may be for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture amendment, I ſhall willingly repeat my former an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; I told you that <hi>Copper</hi> hath a prevailing Acid, whence it is that it reſiſts not only <hi>Vinegar,</hi> and the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Spirit of Venus,</hi> but alſo all Acid Minerals; but <hi>Lead</hi> hath obtained but a very little particle of It by Nature, and therefore it imbibes every Acid, in hopes of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (that I may ſo ſpeak) as I have ſhewed in <hi>Alcalyes.</hi> This is the cauſe why <hi>Lead</hi> is ſimilitudinarily called by Philoſophers, <hi>The firſt matter of Metals,</hi> or the <hi>Alcaly</hi> of Metals, in reſpect of other Metals, which are more or leſs richer in Acid. Gold is moſt Acid, and therefore moſt perfect, as I have ſhewed in the 2. Chapter. See how eaſily I have extricated my ſelf out of theſe great Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties!</p>
                     <p>Some of <hi>Ours</hi> may wonder why I ſpend time in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo plain, for <hi>Baſilius Valentinus</hi> an Age ago hath taught us how to prepare this <hi>Vinegar</hi> out of <hi>Aerugo,</hi> in juventure, and he called it not by the name of <hi>Spirit of Venus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spirit of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> is <hi>Vinegar.</hi>
                        </note> but <hi>Vinegar</hi> (for he knew well (ſo do not the <hi>Deans</hi> and their Fellows) that it was eſtabliſhed by the decree of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Creator, That the more excellent Nature, ſhould not degenerate into the worſer) which is proved by the remaining <hi>Faex</hi> or <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> left in the Retort, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſtillation of this <hi>Vinegar,</hi> which, with <hi>Borax,</hi> by an eaſie Fuſion returns into <hi>Copper;</hi> an evident Argument That <hi>Copper</hi> loſt none of its Subſtance, or excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue (as they ſay:) See more in my <hi>Hppocrates Chymicus,</hi> chap. 29.</p>
                     <p>For concluſion of this Chapter, I repeat, That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the World hath, is begot, preſerved, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Acid Spirit, either Occult or Manifeſt, to which it owes its <hi>All;</hi> And That the Soul dwells in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35121:113"/>Acid, and is inſeparably bound to it; and that the Body, or Alcaly, is informed according to the property of the Acid <hi>Spirit.</hi> If therefore Nature be alike in every thing, and Art doth imitate Nature, as <hi>Pythagoras, Hippocrates,</hi> and Experience teach, it muſt needs follow, That when the Acid Spirit of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> diſtilled from <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> hath corroded Corals, and hath been abſorbed by Them, and coagulated with them, then the Corals will be endued with the properties and conditions of <hi>Vinegar;</hi> not that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Acid, or Form of Corals doth periſh, but only is ſuppreſſed by a more powerful Acid, as I have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the <hi>Magiſtery.</hi> If therefore your celebrated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Venus, <hi>lawfully and duly</hi> (as they ſay) exhibited (though they never yet ſhewed the way) helps <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal, Epileptical,</hi> and <hi>Hyſterical Distempers,</hi> &amp;c. the Magiſtery of Corals (which with a proud and ſwoln breaſt, they call <hi>Our Soluble Magiſtery</hi>) made with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of <hi>Venus,</hi> muſt needs perform much greater things? if otherwiſe, the Spirit muſt animate the Body, to whom it is joyned; as I have hitherto clearly and experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſhewn, and ſhall hereafter ſhew.</p>
                     <p>But as <hi>their Spirit of Venus lawfully and duly adminiſtred,</hi> is the beſt to ſeaſon a Vinegar Veſſel, ſo alſo it hath, and will always retain the nature of <hi>Wine-Vinegar,</hi> till it become like <hi>Alcaheſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But our <hi>Maſter Deans,</hi> with the reſt of their Colledg-Company, out of the treaſure of their Liberality, have lately diſcovered to us a great Secret, which had lain hid to this very day;<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Vinegar</hi> clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</note> 
                        <hi>viz. That their Counterfeit Spirit of Venus helps the Tooth-ach:</hi> neither could we learn it out of <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> his Hiſtory of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> unleſs it had been diſcovered to the World in a Dream, or by hidden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation: But as <hi>Vinegar</hi> doth diſſolve Corals, ſo it ſcours off, and takes away the hardned <hi>Mucus</hi> or Filth about the Teeth, that the Gums may be again united to the Teeth; for ſound and ſharp-pointed Gums admit not Pain, but when they are forced to recede by Filth, and the <hi>Teeth</hi> are never ſo little denudated or bared, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently upon the ſolution of a <hi>continuum,</hi> the Blood ſours, putrefies, and is coagulated there into an hard <hi>Faex</hi> (which

                     <p>And thus you have, O ye ſincere lovers of Truth, the entire Tragoedy, the Riſe and Overthrow of this <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Spirit of Venus,</hi> which, with all its Eximious Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, cannot cure the ſlothfulneſs of theſe Approvers and Subſcribers; ſo that it happens to them, as to thoſe mens Children, who hire other mens Farms; for They ſeeing their Fathers (they themſelves being yet but Children) gathering in the fruits, and commanding the labourers, do preſently conclude the <hi>ſoil</hi> is theirs, and ſo are very Jocund: but when they grow up, and underſtand that there was nothing <hi>Theirs,</hi> but the labour of Tilling the Ground, then their Mirth is turned into Sorrow.

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> That no Matter can be ſo destroyed, but It will remain under ſome Form or other.</head>
                     <p>I Shewed in the fore-going Chapter, that Acids do draw Alcalyes to their own properties, and that Both are changed into Salts. But thoſe which are not fully Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes, when a noble Acid <hi>ſupervenes</hi> upon them, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Acid is indeed abated, but not ſo waſted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, that any other new thing can be <hi>Regenerated</hi> out of it.</p>
                     <p>I will now proceed to prove by the following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that Mechanically, That all Alcalyes do, after a ſort, retain of the Form, with which the <hi>Mixta</hi> were ſaturated, before they were reduced by Fire, into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caly;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35121:114"/>of which ſee <hi>Hippoc.

This Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is called by <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> and their Operators, and by all Lovers of Phyſick, <hi>Precipitation;</hi> which name I ſhall alſo retain and uſe.</p>
                     <p>Out of the <hi>Faeces</hi> of diſtilled <hi>Vinegar,</hi> burnt into Aſhes, <hi>Alcaly of Tartar</hi> is elicited by water, and though <hi>It</hi> be produced out of the ſame Vine with Wine, yet it Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitates <hi>Mercury,</hi> diſſolved as before, ſparkling and ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                     <p>But when the ſame Alcaly is calcined to Redneſs with a moiſt fire, then the ſame <hi>Mercury</hi> falls like pounded <hi>Cinnabar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the <hi>Tartar</hi> being burnt, if you ſuperadd the <hi>Calx,</hi> and extract the Alcaly with Simple Water, the <hi>Mercury</hi> is Precipitated <hi>Rutilant.</hi> Calx of it ſelf, doth not Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate <hi>Mercury</hi> ſo diſſolved, ſince it is Salt from Acid and Alcaly; and they who againſt Experience do deny the ſaltneſs of <hi>Calx,</hi> are to be reckoned in the number of Fools. But if the Liquor of <hi>Mercury</hi> afore-ſpoken of, into which a piece of <hi>Calx</hi> hath been injected, be ſuffered to reſt for ſome hours, ſo long until the Acid, which contains the diſſolved <hi>Mercury,</hi> can ſuppreſs <hi>That</hi> in the <hi>Calx,</hi> then indeed <hi>Mercury</hi> is forced to fall by little and little, and to ſtick round about the <hi>Calx,</hi> like <hi>Minium;</hi> a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful ſpectacle to Curious Eyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Alcaly</hi> extracted from the Herb <hi>Kaly,</hi> being incine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, doth Precipitate <hi>Mercury</hi> much more obſcure than the former.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lixivium,</hi> which Sope-Maſters call <hi>Magiſtra,</hi> which conſiſts of <hi>Calx</hi> and artificial <hi>Alcaly,</hi> yields <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> darkly Yellow.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>All the foreſaid Alcalyes, as well thoſe burnt by a ſharp Flame for <hi>Sope</hi> and <hi>Nitre,</hi> as the Medicinal ones, from <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalick Herbs,</hi> do Precipitate <hi>Mercury</hi> ſo diſſolved (as I have ſaid) of a different colour, a manifeſt Argument, that their Form is not totally conſumed by the Fire, but that they preſerve ſome properties of their Simples, from whence they were extracted; as <hi>Geber</hi> ſays, <hi>Salt retains the property of that thing, from whence it had its Original:</hi> To which the Experience, which I have ſhewn, bears witneſs.</p>
                     <p>Heretoſore I was of opinion, that the difference of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in <hi>Sublimate Mercury,</hi> diſſolved as before, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated by Alcalyes, did proceed from the Fire, acting more or leſs upon the <hi>Alcaly,</hi> but at length, by frequent Experience, I have found my miſtake; for <hi>day to day, and night to night ſheweth Knowledge</hi> we are not all born <hi>Maſters,</hi> nor can we all be <hi>Lullies;</hi> but Age, frequent Uſe, and Experience do manifeſt the Truth. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> alſo, being better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, did Conrect, their <hi>Errors;</hi> ſo that it is no ſhame for me, a ſlow witted Perſon, to amend the mistakes committed in my youth eſpecially, ſeeing had not Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35121:115"/>from whom I might excerp any thing, as they have, who ſeek for Glory in gathering together Receipts; niether had I any other guide, ſave the fountain of all Vertue: ſo that I have bolted out the Truth (by immenſe Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Labour, and not a little Expence) from the fountain of Nature, by my own Induſtry: Wherefore to demonſtrate the conſtancy of Forms, be it known to you, That I can find no better nor ſhorter way, than that which I have ſhewed by the alterations of <hi>Mercury,</hi> upon the affuſion of Alcalyes. For when I endeavour to declare the Forms, with the ſame labour, the Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Mercury</hi> doth voluntarily offer and diſcover it ſelf; which yet running, being diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the affuſion of Alcaly of <hi>Tartar,</hi> is precipitated into a colour obſcurely Yellow.</p>
                     <p>All the aforeſaid Precipitated Powders of <hi>Mercury,</hi> are of a <hi>Cauſtick</hi> and <hi>Corroſive</hi> Property, becauſe the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> assumes the nature of that thing with which it is firſt mixed; and the Cauſtickneſs is not waſted off by any Artifice, but by fire alone, as <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus</hi> ſhews.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, <hi>Mercury</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and <hi>evaporated</hi> to Siccity, the Fire being encreaſed, that the bottom of the Veſſel may be Red-hot, is made a moſt Red ſparkling Powder, and is called in Phyſick, the <hi>Precipitate of Vigoe,</hi> becauſe <hi>Johana de Vigoe,</hi> a <hi>Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geen</hi> of great Fame, was the Inventor of it; on which Red and ſparkling Powder,<note place="margin">

                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:35121:115"/>with many other <hi>Anodine Ingredients,</hi> to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Pains of the Joynts, ariſing from an inveterate <hi>Lues Venera,</hi> with <hi>happy</hi> ſucceſs; which to this day retains the <hi>Author's</hi> Name, and is called, <hi>Vigo's Emplaiſter of Froggs with Mercury.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that <hi>Johannes de Vigo</hi> hath delivered to us, Two Medicaments made of Common <hi>Quick-Mercury,</hi> one Eſcarotick and Deterging, the other Anodine and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaging Pains. He, and with him the whole Senate of <hi>Chyrurgeons,</hi> intimating thereby, That <hi>Anodines</hi> are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary to <hi>Eſcaroticks,</hi> yet nevertheleſs, out of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Ignorance, or both, They pervert the Text and Meaning of this worthy Man, proving themſelves Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries in the Law againſt Him (whoſe Defence I now take upon me) and they do moreover deride him for Teaching, that the <hi>Mercury</hi> is to be quenched with <hi>Oyl of Bayes</hi> according to Art, and with Spittle; but as out of groſs Ignorance, leavened with Inſincerity of mind, they have mutilated and defamed my <hi>Hippocrates Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> ſo also they have ſuborned a Senſe quite contrary to the intention of the Author;<note place="margin">The Anodine Plaiſter of <hi>Vigo</hi> deform'd into a Cauſtick.</note> for He boiles this love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Couply, live <hi>Mercury</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> with <hi>Vipers Greaſe</hi> and <hi>Oyl,</hi> till the Aqueous moiſture he ſpent; affirming and giving out, that in boiling, this Cauſtick is dulcified and made ſweet, which is contrary both to Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and the manifeſt Truth.</p>
                     <p>Now if you deſire to have it <hi>ſweet,</hi> 'tis enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh it with Oyl and Spittle, according to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Meaning; or elſe take <hi>ſweet Mercury,</hi> as it s ſold in <hi>Apothecaries</hi> ſhops, for neither of them are touched by Alcalyes, becauſe they have nothing of <hi>acuteneſs</hi> in them, as I ſhall anon Mechanically ſhew.</p>
                     <p>I ſhewed a little before, That <hi>Quick-ſilver,</hi> or <hi>Live Mercury</hi> (call it as you pleaſe) diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and precipitated with Alcaly of Tartar, doth fall in an obſcurely Yellow colour, the Alcaly for the moſt part abſorbing from it the Acid Cauſtick impreſſed on it by the <hi>Aqua Fortis.</hi> But in <hi>This</hi> Plaiſter, the <hi>Mercury</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> is <hi>ſeethed</hi> with <hi>Axungia of Vipers,</hi> to the conſumption of the Aqueous Humid, and the Maſs
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35121:116"/>becomes of a Grey colour; upon which Maſs if you pour Alcaly of <hi>Tartar,</hi> in the ſpace of half an hour, you ſhall ſee the Alcaly penetrating the Fat, to conſume the <hi>Acid Corroſive</hi> left by the <hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> to be obſcurely Yellow, after the ſame manner, as it happens in <hi>Mercury,</hi> and ſimply diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> Precipitated according to <hi>Vigo's</hi> mind. And therefore <hi>Mercury</hi> ſo diſſolved, and boiled with <hi>Axungia,</hi> becomes not <hi>ſweet</hi> at all, as the fooliſh Doctors falſly ſay, but it remains <hi>corroſive,</hi> even by their own confeſſion; for they affirm, <hi>That Mercury diſſolved in Aqua Fortis, by boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Axungia, becomes ſweet;</hi> yet afterwards they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, <hi>that Impoſthumations, Putrid Fleſh, and the like, are conſumed by it;</hi> which two Aſſertions are diametrically contrary one to another: This is that which made <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> to break forth into a ſmiling laughter, and to ſay, <hi>They know not what they do.</hi> From their Fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and Works, you ſhall know them <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Works of Fire prove true Fire, and <hi>Mercury</hi> conſuming Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtumes is true <hi>Precipitate,</hi> becauſe it performes the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of <hi>Mercury Precipitate,</hi> as I have ſhewed by their own Confeſſion, and alſo by the affuſion of Alcaly; for they are both obſcurely Yellow, as well the Red <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate</hi> of <hi>Vigo,</hi> as This boiled with <hi>Greaſe</hi> or <hi>Axungia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truly the condition of Mortals is to be lamented, whileſt <hi>Phyſick,</hi> which is the Nobleſt and Famouſelſt of all Sciences, in our days, is ſuffered to be directed by Stupid Ignorants, and for this reaſon it is juſtly proclaimed the <hi>meaneſt of all Arts.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Do not our Anceſtors, thoſe ſhining Lights of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, teach us, That Terreſtrial <hi>Mercury</hi> is as the Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial? And thoſe things which are in the Superior, are alſo in the Inferior World? And to what Planet <hi>Mercury</hi> is joyned <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to what Vertue it is united, it takes upon it the nature of the ſame, ſince it is pregnant with the ſeeds of all things.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Johannes de Vigo</hi> did conſider Terreſtrial <hi>Mercury,</hi> as Cauſtick,<note place="margin">Precipitate <hi>Mercury,</hi> Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlick,</note> whence by the advice of his Predeceſſors, he joyned It with an Earthly Planet, whoſe Vertue was Fiery and Cauſtick; it embraced the nature of This, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35121:116"/>became Cauſtick, according to the Doctrine of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and is called the <hi>Precipitate Mercury of Vigo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Vigo</hi> wanted a <hi>Terreſtrial Anodine of Mercury,</hi> whence alſo, following the fame Doctrine of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, he joyned it with Anodine things, viz. <hi>Greaſes,</hi> or <hi>Suets, Cyles, Froggs,</hi> whoſe nature it aſſumed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Anodine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that <hi>Mercury</hi> takes the form of That, by which it is diſſolved, and it is mingled with it, as I have ſhewed clearly enough, concerning the Alcalyes of <hi>Vegetables He that hath Ears to hear, let him hear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hence it appears, That the Inventor of the <hi>Precipitate,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Anodyne</hi> Plainſter (whether it were <hi>Vigo,</hi> or any one elſe, it is not my part to enquire in this place) was not only a Man of Experience, but an Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo of the Cauſes of Things, and conſequently a <hi>Wiſe Man;</hi> So that it is a piece of frivolous and abſurd Ignorance, and Fanatick Dotage, to go about to <hi>reform</hi> actions of knowing Perſons: Out of my pitty to ſuch Undertakers, I ſhall do them the beſt ſervice to bury this their inſipid Diſcourſe, in perpetual ſilence, leſt they ſhould be expoſed to the laughter and deriſion of Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Water <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> yea of the Vulgar it ſelf: I wiſh they would learn hereafter, what they know not, before they babble forth their Scurrilities againſt the Truth, and the Ancient <hi>Hippocratical</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Phyſick.</hi> At this game I confeſs <hi>you</hi> are ſuperior to me, for you know how to paint and ſet forth the fooleries of men, ſo neatly, that in this art I muſt needs lay down the Bucklers. But that your diſeaſe may not be <hi>Chronical,</hi> pray have a care how you often vomit out ſuch things?</p>
                     <p>Moreover <hi>Mercury Precipitate,</hi> now made Cauſtick by the <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> for conſuming Putrid Fleſh, as all Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Chyrurgeens</hi> acknowledge, may be mixed, as Exigency requires, with any Oyntment. To what purpoſe then is this <hi>Anodine</hi> compoſition with Precipitate? eſpecially in Countries where <hi>Vipers greaſe</hi> is ſold dearer than Gold? whence this Greaſe is not only mixed with the <hi>Precipitate</hi> againſt the intent of the Inventor, but moreover is odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and troubleſome to <hi>Apothecaries</hi> (eſpecially ſince
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35121:117"/>
                        <hi>Hogs-greaſe</hi> will do as well with <hi>precipitate</hi>) as alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable to the Sick.</p>
                     <p>You have now heard, O ye Truth-reſpecting hearers, on what ground this <hi>Plaiſter of Froggs,</hi> with <hi>Mercury,</hi> hath been <hi>reformed.</hi> It is your part, to judge whether that ingenious Perſon, <hi>John de Vigo,</hi> deſerves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumeliouſly Reproached for this? And, whether That barren, inſipid, and truthleſs Doctrine be to be ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which Rails againſt both the order of Nature, and alſo the wiſe inſtitutions of our Anceſtors? by which, hopeful Youth in tender years being ſeaſoned, the Poyſon of Ignorance and Unskilfulneſs grows up with them, and ſo the wound becomes Incurable. But theſe things, were not of ſo great moment, if the Health of Man were not endangered thereby; for they preſcribe to the Sick, <hi>Simple</hi> water for Cordial, <hi>Vinegar</hi> for an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick Remedy, Cauſticks for Anodines; Poyſon of <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> for a wholſome Medicine. Sick and weak Perſons can hope for no Cure from ſuch men, but only a fooliſh profuſion of their money, and at length the loſs of their lives to boot: Let them then avaunt, and be packing to the fartheſt <hi>Garamantes,</hi> with their <hi>Spirit of Venus,</hi> and their <hi>Gounterfeit receits;</hi> Let them not trouble the Civil World; Let them <hi>there weep,</hi> like Women, ſince <hi>here</hi> they have not acquitted themſelves like Men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Order</hi> now requires,<note place="margin">Sublimate Mercury.</note> that I ſhould ſhew what <hi>Mercury</hi> Sublimated is? ſince I have laid <hi>That</hi> down, as an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the examen of of Alcalyes?

Where obſerve, that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol</hi> Rubefied, or Calcined to Redneſs, is not added, to encreaſe the weight of the <hi>Mercury</hi> (as theſe magnifick Maſters with their Partizans, do ſuppoſe) for then it would not be calcined to the higheſt Red, but to White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs only, as is done in the diſtillation of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> whoſe <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> left after diſtillation of the Spirit, is moſt fit for this purpoſe; and therefore-we need not its <hi>Spirit</hi> to add weight to the <hi>Mercury</hi>) but it is added, that the Sulphureous <hi>Nitre</hi> might apprehend the Sulphur of the immature Metal, lying hid in the Rubefied <hi>Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol;</hi> as I have ſhewed before; and ſo by their joynt-forces
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35121:117"/>they may diſſolve the <hi>Mercury.</hi> This is the reaſon why Rubefied <hi>Vitriol</hi> is required. But the quantity is Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple in reſpect of the Salts, becauſe Theſe are of eaſie fuſion in the Fire, from the which by Rubefied <hi>Vitriol,</hi> they are preſerved: ſee more in <hi>Hippoc, Chymic,</hi> in the fore-cited <hi>chapter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame <hi>Mercury</hi> once ſublimated, needs not again be re-ſublimated with new Powders, as the unskilful <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers</hi> think, becauſe it doth not put off or depoſe the Acid Spirits once abſorbed, ſo as to ſtand in need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume the ſame from new Powders: and ſuppoſe that it were ſublimated an hundred times with new Powder, yet it would never become purer, as they falſly affirm; the reaſon is, becauſe this way the External Sulphur is not ſeparated, neither doth <hi>Suſcipere magis velminus,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though (<hi>Legitimately,</hi> as they fay) a thouſand, yea an hundred thouſand times it be reſublimated; And the word <hi>Legitimately</hi> in this place, doth diſcover their groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſtands for no other uſe, but to be nauſceous to the underſtandings of Wife-Men; but it receives as much as is enough for its ſaturation, as they know well, who have ſometimes diſſolved <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Aqua Fortis;</hi> which if it be not ſufficiently Powerful, the Gram of <hi>Mercury</hi> remains untouched and quick, becauſe it could not imbibe That which was not; and on the other ſide, the water could not diſſolve it, becauſe it wanted Acid Salt. Truly this word <hi>(Legitimate)</hi> with this <hi>(purer Mercury)</hi> and the reſt of their falſe Receits may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough be diſcarded and abandoned even by the Punieſt <hi>Apothecaries,</hi>

                        </note> But when ſublimate <hi>Mercury</hi> is freed from the Acid Spirits by Vegetable Alcaly, and is fetched back quite from the Retort, then indeed it may be mixed with new Powders, and again ſublimated; which way the Deans with their fellows are yet ignorant of: yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it would not become <hi>more pure</hi> and <hi>ſplendant,</hi> becauſe in its firſt ſublimation it neglected all that, which was not of its own nature in the Faeces and <hi>Caput Mortuum:</hi> but it would come over and return in leſs quantity, becauſe it would return to Elements by frequent ſublimation and revivification, as I have ſhewed above concerning Alcaly
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35121:118"/>of <hi>Tartar,</hi> concerning Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and concerning <hi>Vinegar:</hi> ſee <hi>Hippoc. Chym. chap.</hi> 10.</p>
                     <p>This foreſaid mixture of <hi>Mercury</hi> with Rubefied <hi>Vitriol, Nitre,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> if you ſublime it, not by little and little, but in great haſte, and more than is fit, the <hi>Mercury</hi> will concrete, in the top of the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> into lucid and great Chryſtals, like <hi>Nitre,</hi> and not inferior to a Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond in luſtre, which theſe Babblers vaunt for a great Secret, and affirm it to be <hi>The pureſt Mercury.</hi> For whom the ſpeech of <hi>Mercury</hi> in <hi>Sendivogius</hi> may well be applied, <hi>That 'tis natural for him to laugh at fools;</hi> which Diſeaſe, as <hi>Cardan</hi> ſays, they may eaſily Cure without a Cudgel, by eating Hens brains, the Teſticles of Doves and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes, and by drinking a little White-wine Vinegar every day: If <hi>Cardan</hi> had had any knowledge of this child of <hi>Venus</hi> (newly born to theſe Obſtreperous <hi>Doctors</hi>) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he would have <hi>preferred</hi> it before <hi>Vinegar, ſince duly exhibited, it cures Epileptick and Melancholy perſons,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Phyſical Doctors of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> and <hi>Norimberg</hi> Colledge. In the interim let their humours be purged with black <hi>Hellebore,</hi> would all <hi>Anticyra</hi> had enough of it; Let them drink <hi>Capon-broth,</hi> and ſmell to the flowers of <hi>Nymphaea,</hi> which, with their grateful ſmell do mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chear nhe ſpirits of the Heart; and engrave <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in a Topaze, walking <hi>Tempe.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Cardan,</hi> to which I add, that unleſs theſe overwiſe Doctors, with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows had approved and owned this <hi>child of Venus;</hi> the ſimpleſt man alive would never have believed there was ever any ſuch thing.

                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude therefore, I affirm, that neither <hi>Mercury</hi> ſublimated, or precipitated, ill handled with <hi>Vipers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaſe,</hi> and mortified in <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> and alſo mixed with <hi>Alcalyes,</hi> and Revivificated with a naked fire out of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort, and by conſequence, weak and frail, as <hi>Alcalyes,</hi> nor no other <hi>Matter,</hi> can be ſo deſtroyed, but it will ſtill ſhew ſomething of its Form.</p>

                     <p>So a Pearl poſſeſſes, in reſpect of its body, the 8200. part of innate moſt precious Acid, upon which, if there <hi>ſupervene</hi> a more powerful Acid, taken from another fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, <hi>vsz.</hi> from <hi>Vinegar</hi> diſtilled from <hi>Aerugo</hi> (which they ridiculouſly call a <hi>Secret Menſtruum</hi>) and doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Tyranny over it, The <hi>Rector</hi> in the Pearl is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and that clear and precious light, the Child of the Sun, is ſlain, which would willingly have relieved the Vital <hi>Lumen</hi> of the Sick, unleſs it had been unjuſtly ſubjugated by the Vinegar from <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> that is, the <hi>falſe Spirit of Venus.</hi> Pearl therefore, ſo diſſolved, can do no good, unleſs the weak Stomach of the Patient can ſubdue and conquer that Acid Salt (as I have before ſhewed in magiſtery of Corals) left there by the <hi>Vinegar.</hi> For as <hi>Vinegar</hi> diſtilled from <hi>Verdigreaſe,</hi> doth rule over, and ſubdue the vital <hi>light</hi> of Pearls, 'tis ſo in Diſeaſes, <hi>viz.</hi> The Vital <hi>light</hi> is ſuppreſſed by the more Potent Morbous <hi>Acid</hi> (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, <hi>De veteri Medicina</hi>) which if it be imbibed, as the Acid by the Alcaly, or if it be diluted and ſeparated from the affected place, the Vital <hi>light</hi> ſoon recovers: ſee <hi>Hippoc.

From the Air! whether will ye go? ſtrait to <hi>Anticyra,</hi> I adviſe you, with the company going before you for your Cure. For Philoſophers ſay, that Air is Natures <hi>Sieve,</hi> through which Vertues and Influences are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and that it is impatient of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> no ways condenſable of it ſelf, but an immortal and moſt ſubtil Fume, kindled from the heavenly Fire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have ſhewed before, that in <hi>It,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi>'s Child doth inhabit, which, aſſumes not a Body, unleſs with his beloved Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; The authority and experience both of the Old, and alſo the Modern true Philoſophers bear witneſs hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: So that the Air being moſt ſubtil and incondenſible of it ſelf, can add no weight to the <hi>Minium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Air it ſelf, is neither light nor heavy, neither is it compreſſed of its own accord, but by ſome force, in the barrel of a Gun, from which it again breaks out by force: we ſee the ſame thing in that Glaſſy <hi>Organ,</hi> which is called a <hi>Weather-glaſs,</hi> the Air indeed is compreſſed in it, by <hi>Cold,</hi> but is again rarefied and dilated by <hi>Heat.</hi> If therefore the Air, in a <hi>cold</hi> ſeaſon, did add weight to the <hi>Minium,</hi> it would make it lighter in an <hi>hot:</hi> But <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> weighs alike in all Seaſons; ſo that it is not the <hi>Air</hi> that gives weight to the <hi>Minium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing, though not granting, that the Child of the <hi>Sun,</hi> dwelling in the Air, did aſſume a body in
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35121:120"/>the <hi>Minium;</hi> yet this would not be, but in ſome years ſpace; as I have ſhewed in the Matrix of <hi>Nitre</hi> and Mines of <hi>Vitriol.</hi> But <hi>Minium,</hi> newly drawn out from the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace and as yet hot, weighs as much as it will do ſome years after; ſo that the Child of the <hi>Sun,</hi> neither hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tabernacle in the <hi>Minium,</hi> nor gives any weight to it.</p>
                     <p>The Air being impatient of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> as I have ſhewed by the authority of Philoſophers, is always filled with an Aqueous Humour, which in the cold preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes to Water. Take a familiar houſhold example, when we drink cold things in the hot Summer-time, out of a Glaſs, as ſoon as the Glaſs is filled with the cold Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, preſently it is troubled, becauſe the Aqueous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, diſperſed through the Air, is condenſed by the Cold, and ſticks there, in ſo great quantity, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times drops do fall down: Here they wonderfully lift up their Creſts, and cry aloud rejoycingly, <hi>Now you are catched;</hi> This is that Aqueous Vapor, which is attracted by the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium</hi> out of the Air, and adds the weight to it; but ſoft and fair, Your Aqueous Vapor doth concrete in <hi>Cold,</hi> and again rarefy in <hi>hot</hi> Weather, which your ridiculous and childiſh Experiment proves, <hi>viz. The Caput Mortuum of Vitriol</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Faex of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> out of which the Spirits by one ſingle diſtillation, have been drawn) <hi>being expoſed to the Air, is again ſaturated with Spirit of Vitriol; which, if it be diſtilled, doth again yiold Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lo, O Curious and Truth-loving <hi>Reader,</hi> This is their Proof (that as the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> is again ſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Spirit in the Air; ſo alſo <hi>Minium</hi> drawn from the Furnace, is ſaturated out of the Air with weight.) which is both Childiſh and Ridiculous; and, as I have ſhewed all the reſt to be falſe, and ill underſtood, ſo I ſhall like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe demonſtrate <hi>This</hi> to be moſt falſe, and leaſt of all underſtood by the whole <hi>Colledge</hi> of Gueſſers.</p>
                     <p>For if <hi>Vitriol</hi> have once undergone the tyranny of a quick Fire, the Child of the <hi>Sun</hi> acts no more upon it, than it doth on an Egg boiled, for the hatching of the Chick: Now burnt <hi>Vitriol</hi> doth attract from the Air by reaſon of its drineſs, becauſe it is without moiſture, not the Acid
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35121:121"/>Spirit of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> but an Aqueous Vapor; which, when the <hi>Vitriol</hi> grows hot, either by the <hi>Sun,</hi> or by Fire, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain flies into Air, as it is the property of all Water. For if that <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> could again re-aſſume the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Vitriol</hi> in the Air, that Famous Diſtiller of <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> who furniſhes not only near the third part of <hi>Europe,</hi> but alſo all Ships, and both the <hi>Indies</hi> therewith, yearly expending many thouſands of pounds upon it; if it being once Diſtilled and Expoſed to the Air, would again become <hi>Vitriol,</hi> he would have luck in a Bag, as we ſay: but as it is falſe, that the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of <hi>Vitriol</hi> returns to <hi>Vitriol,</hi> ſo it is alſo an untruth, that the Aqueous Vapor adds weight to the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um;</hi> which I prove by this Experiment.</p>
                     <p>Take at leaſt an Ounce of <hi>Minium,</hi> ſuch as is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſold, and in a Glazed Earthen Veſſel, large and low, put it for a Night in a Bakers hot Oven, or elſe expoſe it to the Noon-day Sun; whoſe heat as it doth exiccate not only the <hi>Humid Minium,</hi> but alſo dries up Mariſhes, Lakes, and Rivers; ſo in like manner it would expel the Humidity of the Air, if there were any in the <hi>Minium:</hi> but the ſame weight of <hi>Minium</hi> which was put in, is alſo drawn forth from the Oven, or heat of the Sun; ſo that That which gives weight to the <hi>Minium,</hi> is not the Child of the Sun, nor the Air, nor Water; therefore, againſt the abſurd prateing of the <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Approvers,</hi> it muſt needs be the <hi>Acidity</hi> in the kindled Flame, which, as the falſe Spirit of <hi>Venus</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing tyranny over the Debile Acid in the <hi>Medulla</hi> of Pearls, or in Coral, adds weight to Them, ſo alſo the <hi>Acid</hi> kindled in the Flame, which by its tyrannical power and force doth keep down and ſuppreſs the Debile Acid in the Lead, is fixed into Alcaly, rules over it, and gives weight to it; <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> Chap. 26.</p>
                     <p>We may learn from hence, that if the Reader (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he be, enquiring after the truth, in thoſe infinite doubts, which in long Art do daily occur) ſhould have recourſe to theſe <hi>Denns</hi> and their <hi>Aſſociates,</hi> what profit could he get thereby? Surely none, which plainly appears, by that counterfeit and lamentable piece of Science, which they had forth to the whole World; for they call <hi>Simple
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35121:121"/>Water Volatile Salt of Tartar,</hi> and moreover judge it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Cordial. Beſides, with what pompous and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Words, do they ſhameleſly adorn it? and commend <hi>it</hi> to their poor Neighbours, and to the Sick? as I have ſhewed above in the Chapter of the <hi>Difference of Salts,</hi> in their own Words there quoted: They ſay alſo, <hi>That Vinegar Diſtilled is the Son of</hi> Venus, <hi>that Acid is not in Graines of Kermes,</hi> that <hi>Gold is not Fixed and Conſtant in the Fire;</hi> that Mercury <hi>corroded with Cauſtick Water is made ſweet by boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Vipers Greaſe;</hi> that Minium <hi>acquires weight from the Air;</hi> and infinite other abſurdities, which I ſhall anon diſcover. Fye for ſhame, defile not Youth, with theſe fooleries and falſities: Diſpute not <hi>de Lana Caprina,</hi> and after the diſpute ended, you ſilence your Opponents in a matter of no value, and gain nothing but an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty puff of breath: And then in your ſilence, Truth, as the Philoſopher ſays, though unſought for, will come to light, if ſhe may. But, leaving theſe Jejune Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Phyſick, who proceed to the Practick Part, as the Aſs to his fodder, not knowing to what he lays his Lips; I ſhall go on to prove, that there is <hi>Acid</hi> in Fire, by This, no leſs Noble, than profitable and pleaſant Example.</p>
                     <p>I ſhewed before, That the Salts of Vegetables do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their forms untouched from Common Fire, and that they illude the violence thereof, either more or leſs: And if ſuch a power be in Vegetables, muſt not the Mineral family attain a degree thereof, more or leſs perfect? To make this out, Let Flint be the Example,<note place="margin">An Enquiry how Flint diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers from Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</note> which is moſt conſtant in the Fire, and Corals (the Red are always to be choſen) leſs conſtant: A Flint (the White is to be choſen) is corroded by no <hi>Acid Liquor,</hi> no not by <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> it ſelf; becauſe it hath obtained a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament equal to its Nature <hi>(i. e.)</hi> it hath got ſo much Acid, as in a juſt Ballance can ſatisfie and ſaturate its Alcaly; for if never ſo little Alcaly did ſuperabound, the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Acid would find an eaſie ingreſs; ſo that a Flint can be diſſolved by no Acid, no not by <hi>the falſe Son of Venus,</hi> in regard of the equal and perfect mixture of the Acid and Alcaly.</p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:35121:122"/>
                     <p> But Corals, not being enriched by Nature, with ſo much Acid, as can ſaturate their own proper Alcaly, are therefore leſs Conſtant; whence it come to paſs, that if you pour any manifeſt Acid on Them, preſently it corrodes them; and ſuch a quanty of the Acid is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed by them, till it be brought to an <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> with the Alcaly, and thereupon the diſſolved Corals be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in weight, as I have ſhewed before in <hi>Magiſtery</hi> prepared the common way.</p>
                     <p>A Flint burnt in the Fire, as it receives not <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Humid</hi> Liquors, ſo it is neither encreaſed nor leſſened in its weight from the <hi>Acid</hi> Flame of the Fire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Acid,</hi> which may avolate, doth not ſuperabound in it; nor is the Alcaly thirſty, which might imbibe the <hi>Acid Salt</hi> of the Corals, or <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> 'tis only the Nutritive Glew which dies; which in Pearls and Crabs Eyes (as I have ſhewed) is like to thin Pellicles or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings, which are not diſſolved by the falſe Spirit of <hi>Venus,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>Pinguous.</hi> But Corals duly burnt, (in the Flame either of Coals or Wood) do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in weight, becauſe there is an overplus of the thirſty <hi>Alcaly</hi> in them, which could not be ſaturated by their proper <hi>Acid:</hi> hence it is, that they eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the External, either humid or kindled in Flame, and ſo far, by means of the received <hi>Acid,</hi> they encreaſe in weight; as I have ſhewed before in <hi>Magiſtery.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Flint burnt in Fire, till it chop and gape, becomes Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, and turns living or dead Fleſh into rottenneſs.</p>
                     <p>But Corals in like manner burnt or calcined in the Fire, till they chop, do not affect either <hi>living</hi> Fleſh or <hi>dead,</hi> becauſe they become a Powder almoſt inſipid.</p>
                     <p>Flint burnt, until the Glew <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the Aliment dies, is called <hi>Calx</hi> or Lime,<note place="margin">Burnt Flint is called <hi>Lime.</hi>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35121:122"/>becauſe they have not ſo much <hi>Acid,</hi> as will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for a mutual Action or Combate, neither is it coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated into a ſtony ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Out of Flint, Calcined with Vegetable Alcaly, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a <hi>Lixivium,</hi> which boiled with Suet or Fat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Sope.</hi>

                     <p>But if you pour the ſame Vinegar on theſe Calcined Corals, they are wholly diſſolved, without either bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles or noiſe, becauſe being ſaturated for ſix days and nights by the Acid Flame, they are no longer Thirſty: on which Solution, pour <hi>True Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> which (as I have ſhewed before) doth keep down the weaker <hi>Acid</hi> of the Diſtilled Vinegar, and aſſociates to its ſelf the <hi>Alcaly</hi> of Corals; but the Fire, or Life of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals is united with the Vinegar, and ſo the whole Compoſition is <hi>Red.</hi> This Redneſs is the Life of Corals, according to <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> which you may learn to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate by the Midwifry of your helping Hand, and you ſhall have a Cordial not to be deſpiſed; of which <hi>Plato</hi> forbids me to ſpeak any more in this place: See <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> Chap. 27.</p>
                     <p>As the Life, or the Acid of Flints, is White, or Dark Colour, or Green, intended according to the innate <hi>humid,</hi> as Vitrification ſhews; ſo of <hi>Red</hi> Corals it is <hi>ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> which difference of Colours and Vertues proceeds from their firſt Seed, which Art cannot effect; if any one pretend to it, he is a Lyer.

                     <p>So that our Calcined Corals become not a <hi>Calx,</hi>

                     <p>Otherwiſe the World would be filled with far fetched, ill underſtood, falſe and dubious <hi>Receits;</hi> and the diligent Obſervations of our Anceſtors would be lightly eſteemed: and ſo a new, unskilful; ambiguous, coſtly, ſpeculative, infinite, and groundleſs way of Phyſick, would take place; which under the diſguiſe of falſe Words and deep Learning, would be entertained by <hi>Ideots;</hi> who not knowing the Vertues of Things, hotly contend amongſt themſelves, and rail one at an other, not only about <hi>Aperitive</hi> or <hi>Aſtringent</hi> Iron, but about many other things; ſome of which I have ſpoken of, as much as the nature of the Argument and the good of my Neighbours require: So alſo by uncertain Concluſions and vain Opinions they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile the Wits of the Studious, and to the hurt of their Neighbour, and the infamy of the Art, they approve and ſubſcribe to <hi>Lying Fables:</hi> And not at all ſtudying the Truth, they boaſt themſelves to be great <hi>Doctors;</hi> who yet never will attain to <hi>Science,</hi> becauſe they follow the herd, that went before, and think they have already <hi>attained</hi> it, as <hi>Seneca</hi> rightly ſpeaks; but to return to the matter.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> handles Iron two manner of ways, either preparing <hi>Ferrugo</hi> out of it, or extinguiſhing It in Water or Wine: yet to both the Preparations, he aſcribes an Aſtringent Vertue; he doth not call the one <hi>Aſtringent</hi> and the other <hi>Aperitive.</hi> For when Iron <hi>opens,</hi> it comes from the ſpecifick Acid, degenerating in the body, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture could not receive into nouriſhment, and therefore, by reaſon of its Acid taſte, it ruſhes to the Iron; ſo the Bowels being ſtrengthened by degrees, Nature expels <hi>That</hi>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:35121:125"/>together with the detained excrements by ſtool. Hence <hi>Helmont</hi> ſays, that Iron doth open by a <hi>ſpecifick</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Vertue, but it <hi>binds</hi> by a <hi>ſecond</hi> quality: ſo that neither of the Vertues of the Iron, do proceed from the abſence or preſence of its <hi>Mercury</hi> (which they boaſt, but without Truth, that they can extract from it) but from the attraction of the ſpecifick Acid in the <hi>Morbous</hi> Bodies, as <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> ſhews, Chap. 16. and 28. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I refer the <hi>Reader,</hi> that I may not clog him with the repetition of things there ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>But we may grant, that they can as well extract <hi>Mercury</hi> from <hi>Iron,</hi> as Eximious Vertues from <hi>Copper:</hi> Theſe Vanities are, and always were, nauſceous to <hi>Me,</hi> as well as to the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Sick;</hi> for they have no foundation in Nature: ſo that they, and their Maſters, are to be baniſhed from the ſociety of good Men; whileſt on the other ſide, I deal with the Doctrine of Truth and the moſt Ancient Science, which the Ancients found to be agreeable to the Nature of Man, and thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be aſcribed to <hi>God,</hi> as the School of Truth yet thinks, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> hath it, <hi>De Veterum Medicina;</hi> for He there teaches, that as there is a manifold <hi>Acid</hi> in the <hi>Macrocoſme,</hi> ſo alſo in Mans Body. And in his Book <hi>de Arte, every Acid hath its proper Ventricle,</hi> which yet the vocal and wordy <hi>Colledge</hi> is ignorant of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he adds, <hi>as they know who ſtudy theſe things;</hi> but ſeeing it is eaſier to ſteal blind <hi>Receits</hi> and to approve them, to ſuppreſs Truth and to load <hi>It</hi> with Calumnies, then to learn the knowledge of the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of Mans Body, 'tis no wonder, that They are ignorant of the Inſtruments of Phyſick, who have no regard to the <hi>Ventricles; For if,</hi> ſays the Old Man, <hi>they do not know the Conſtitution from the beginning, and that which is predominant in the body, they cannot preſcribe that which is good for a Sick Man.</hi> Lo here the Cauſe, why <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> being <hi>Aperitive</hi> in the hands of ſuperficial and ignorant <hi>Doctors,</hi> becomes <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictive,</hi> and <hi>Vice Verſa;</hi> becauſe they are ignorant of their proper Inſtruments: and in the method of Curing, know not how to apply <hi>Active</hi> things to <hi>Paſſive,</hi> becauſe they have not the knowledge of <hi>Ventricles,</hi> or <hi>Sapors:</hi>
                        <pb n="74" facs="tcp:35121:126"/>neither did they ever learn Them out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> of which my <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> doth diſcover very many.</p>
                     <p>This is the reaſon, why, as I ſaid before, they come to <hi>Practice,</hi> as the Aſs to his fodder, not knowing to what he extends his Lips, but only as far as his exterior ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, without underſtanding, by ſeeing and taſting, do draw him to his meat. But why do I inſiſt on the decrees of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> deduced and drawn down from Nature it ſelf, ſince I have to do with ſuch <hi>Perſons,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as dreamt of the <hi>Verity</hi> and <hi>Excellency</hi> of the Art of Phyſick. Therefore they are to be inſtructed by <hi>Examples,</hi> taken out of the Shop of Wiſe Nature.</p>
                     <p>Obſerve then, That in the Stomach and Milt of a ſound Animal, there dwels a Vital Acid proper to the Milt, but when That Acid doth degenerate into an unuſual taſte, or ſapor, all the neighbouring parts are alſo contaminated; and preſently the pores are contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Body, which was tranſpirable in health, now ceaſes from action; hence the <hi>Milt</hi> ſwels from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Ferment,</hi> which will not obey purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as experience ſhews: Now <hi>Iron</hi> taken at mouth, is good for that Ferment and prae-acid Taſte, by which the Milt is leſſened or dried (call it which you will) but not by reaſon of the <hi>Aperitive</hi> force of the Iron, but that Acidity there detained, doth in a ſpecial manner love the Iron, as a thirſty Man doth Beer. Let <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> diſſolved in <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> be an Example.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Aqua Fortis,</hi> hath the ſmell and property of <hi>Sulphur</hi> of Iron, becauſe it is made of Sulphurous Nitre, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol or Allum; whence by reaſon of the likeneſs between them, it loves Copper and Iron, as I have above Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically ſhewed: Now as in the Stomachs of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, the hungry Acid deſires to be ſatisfied with its like, and <hi>That</hi> like <hi>(i. e.)</hi> food, it diſſolves and is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with it; 'tis juſt ſo in the <hi>Matrocoſme:</hi> For Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, The Acidity of <hi>Aqua Eortis,</hi> is as an empty Stomach, which deſires to be ſatisfied; <hi>Silver</hi> being given it for food, it diſſolves it, and is pleaſed with it; but when you caſt in a <hi>Phyſical Drug</hi> (as I may ſo call it) into this Solution, I mean <hi>Copper,</hi> with which, for the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35121:126"/>between them, it is more delighted than with the Silver; preſently it deſerts the Silver, and again diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves the Copper, and the whole Solution becomes green.</p>
                     <p>It muſt needs be ſo alſo in the Body of Man, ſince <hi>Nature is in every thing alike,</hi> as <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and ſince <hi>Him, Hippocrates</hi> have taught us.</p>
                     <p>Again, If you put <hi>Iron</hi> into <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> (which here is as the <hi>Stomach</hi> or <hi>Ventricle</hi>) impregnated or loaded with Copper, in regard Copper is of harder Solution and Concoction than Iron, the Water preſently leaves the Copper and diſſolves the Iron.</p>
                     <p>And although <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> hath already depoſed Silver and Copper, yet its Acidity and Property hath ſtill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them, until they are freed by a melting Fire; which is to be obſerved by <hi>Our Friends,</hi> for it is elſe where of great uſe.</p>
                     <p>But it is objected by ſuch, as are ignorant of this Common and Ancient Order and Conſent of Nature, and who out of their ſmall Skill, go about to overthrow the Hippocratical Verity, <hi>That I put my Sickle into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mans Corn and Harveſt;</hi> as if it were a ſhame for me to know, <hi>That</hi> which all men ſhould or ought to know in an Art; or, as if. They were the only famous Philoſophers, who compile together Surreptitious and ill underſtood <hi>Receits,</hi> without the knowledge of the Cauſes of Things. And as Silver and Copper were troubleſome to the <hi>Stomach</hi> of <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> (that I may ſo ſpeak) which is better, when it is cured with Iron: ſo alſo this Morbóus Forrain Ferment, or Humour (call it which you pleaſe) being conſumed by the Iron, The Ventricle of the Milt and the neighbour parts become botter affected. Take therefore at mouth <hi>Stomoma (i. e.)</hi> Steel, or its <hi>Crocus,</hi> either Aſtringent or Aperitive, with which that Acid Ferment hath a greater agreement than with the Milt; and therefore it haſtily ruſhes in, pervading its Pores from the Ventricle of the Milt to the whole Stomach,<note place="margin">Horat'us his Sterilis Rubigo.</note> that it may aſſociate it ſelf with the aſſumed Iron, which by that Acid Forrain Ferment is diſſolved into a Black or Green <hi>Fax,</hi> according to the property of the Acid;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35121:127"/>as the Excrements of the Belly do teſtify: and if this Acid be not totally conſumed by the Iron, at one turn, it is repeated ſo often, till the Milt ſhew ſome ſigns of its Exiccation; ſo the <hi>Anima</hi> of one <hi>ens (i. e.)</hi> the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Diſeaſe, enters into the Iron, and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima</hi> of another goes out, becauſe the <hi>Acid,</hi> or <hi>Anima</hi> of the Iron, which conſtitutes the Iron, goes forth, (Hence <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> is called by <hi>Horatius, Sterilis Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigo</hi>) that the <hi>Acidity</hi> of the Diſeaſe might again enter in, according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Pythagoreans.</hi> For Nature acts in the <hi>Microcoſme</hi> by the ſame Inſtruments as in the <hi>Macrocoſme:</hi> For the Ancients have taught us, <hi>That it is every where alike.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here Ideots and Deſtroyers of Hippocratical Medicine, will object, That I place a Diſeaſe in the Ventricle of the Milt, and yet give Iron by the Mouth? How then can the <hi>Morbous Acid</hi> come or reach from the Milt to the Iron? as they have alſo written concerning burnt Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn: Which Objection is not worth the anſwering, for one Fool may raiſe more Queſtions than an hundred Wiſe Men can anſwere; but ſithence theſe ſluggiſh <hi>Doctors</hi> never underſtood <hi>This</hi> out of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Sixth Book <hi>de Morbis Popularibus;</hi> out of pitty to them I will ſhew them the place; for he there ſays, <hi>that the whole Body as long as Life is in it, is perſpirable and penetrable;</hi> ſee <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> Chap. 16.</p>
                     <p>But when the Milt or Liver is gone to a <hi>Schirrhus,</hi> then indeed the Steel, by conſuming the <hi>Faber</hi> or <hi>Operant,</hi> would more harden the Bowels, though the <hi>Aperitive Crocus Martis</hi> of all theſe <hi>Subſcribers</hi> be never ſo much taken by the Mouth. He that deſires to know more of <hi>Iron,</hi> let him read <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus</hi> in the fore-cited Chapter.</p>
                     <p>So that the Acid, which Iron conſumes in the Body of Man, differs very much from the <hi>falſe Spirit of Venus,</hi> and from all other Acids in general, becauſe it is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick; and to be found in no other place: for if Iron be not wholly diſſolved by <hi>It</hi> in the Body, the Excrements of the Belly are not tinged into a Black or Green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and then indeed Iron doth <hi>Aſtringe,</hi> though the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35121:127"/>
                        <hi>Aperitive Crocus</hi> of theſe <hi>Innovators</hi> be adminiſtred, as <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc.

Truly this is a rural clowniſh Doctrine, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the <hi>Approvers;</hi> for if <hi>Mediciues</hi> muſt needs paſs out of the Stomach to the Seat of the Diſeaſe, through the Pores, then the Sweat and Urine would wax Red from the <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> eſpecially their <hi>Aperitive Crocus. Bezoar</hi> in Swoonings, doth not paſs through the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes of the Stomach to the Heart, nor doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from thence, for conſuming the Lypothymick Acid: Neither doth <hi>Oſtiocolla</hi> travel to the broken Bone, that it may prohibit or abſorb the Specifick Acid there; neither doth the Stone of a Crab go to the Wound; nor doth a grain of Opium taken at Mouth, for the Head-ach, paſs up or aſcend to the Head. They are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the Subtile Argute Judge, and equal Weigher of all things (which diſtinctly knows the Seminal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, not only of Medicines, but alſo of all other things beſides; and accordingly doth either embrace, <hi>ſegregate,</hi> or neglect <hi>It:</hi>) dwels in the Stomach, as I ſhall ſhew by Experience, Authority, and Reaſon, in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chap. wherefore this indecent kind of ignorance is to be hiſſed out of the School of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and out of Common Life too, <hi>To inſtruct Block heads,</hi> as <hi>Lucian</hi> ſays, <hi>is a greater and nobler Secret,</hi> than the very <hi>Philoſophers Stone;</hi> for it were to transſorm the

The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meaning whereof, he gives us in the foreſaid <hi>Book of Diet,</hi> in a Learned and Profound Interpretation; where alſo he propoſes the Univerſal Generation of all Things, and the Nature of Seeds; which my <hi>Hippoc.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35121:128"/>Water; Fire adorns all things which are in the Body, and can move all things, but Water nouriſhes all, and through all;</hi> becauſe for a need it abounds with <hi>Alcaly:</hi> as I have ſhewed before by evident Examples, by which a ſolid ſubſtance is concocted by inſpiſſation; againſt the opinion of theſe <hi>gain ſayers:</hi> but the <hi>Fire,</hi> of which the Old Man ſpeaks in this place, is not <hi>culinary</hi> Fire, as he ſhews in the ſame Book: Man, ſays he, <hi>Threſhes, Waſhes, and Grindes Bread-Corn, and after it is baked in the Fire, he uſes it, but with a ſtrong Fire in its Body; it is not made up, but with a ſoft and gentle one;</hi> ſo that it is a <hi>ſoft</hi> Fire, which adorns and moves all things, which in the 2 Chap. of this Book, and here and there beſides, throughout the whole Book, I have ſhewed by many Examples to be <hi>Acid;</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall likewiſe further ſhew.</p>
                     <p>So that <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcaly</hi> (call them which you will) is that <hi>Balſam,</hi> which is given to Bodies for <hi>Salt,</hi> That they putrefie not; and in very deed it is Salt, as <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus</hi> ſhews from the 12 to the 16 Chapter; and it will more fully appear in the progreſs.

Hence that ſaying, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>bifames, laborandum non eſt,</hi> &amp;c. Now that which is <hi>its like,</hi> is not that External Body of Fleſh or Bread, which we touch, ſince Man lives not only by Viſible Bread, but by the innate Calid of the Aliments; which as ſoon as ever it is embraced by the Stomach, even before it be heated there, preſently the ſtrength of the Body is repaired.</p>
                     <p>This innate <hi>Calid</hi> is alſo in <hi>Lettice,</hi> ſo that the <hi>Acid</hi> of the Stomach after it is conſumed by the Aliment, and is paſſed into Radical Humid or Moiſture, immediately the Stomach Contracts it ſelf, and the whole Body Languiſhes
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35121:129"/>for want of <hi>It.</hi> Hence ariſeth Hunger and Appetite of Food, ſo that an hungry Man, though he be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by long Faſting or by Labour, yet upon the taking of Food or Drink, yea of one Cup of Wine only, he finds himſelf immediately refreſhed; and that, before the Food begins to be chylified; becauſe the deficient Acid is reſtored by <hi>That</hi> which was in the Meat, Drink, Bread or Wine, though imperceptibly, as to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes. Whence <hi>Hippoc.</hi> ſays, <hi>Aliment is that, which is turned into Spiritual Vapours; by ſuch as theſe the Vital Spirits, which are the Authors of the Active, are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</hi> For as I ſhewed before, That as every Acid Spirit carries the <hi>Anima</hi> inſeparably in its belly, and gets dominion over that body, into which it is infuſed; immediately forming <hi>it</hi> according to its own nature, as I gave examples, <hi>chap.</hi> 6. in Spirit of Salt; which being <hi>poured</hi> into Alcaly of Tartar, preſently forms to it ſelf a Saline Body, agreeable to its own Nature, and becomes <hi>Salt;</hi> and Spirit of Vinegar, or Diſtilled Vinegar, in the ſame Alcaly of Tartar, forms to it ſelf a Body, adaequate to its proper nature, and becomes <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of Wine:</hi> The like may be ſaid of Vitriol, and other Acids: So alſo the Acid of the Stomack of a Man, when it lays hold on Bread, or any nouriſhing thing, over which it may have dominion, it doth turn and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute it into <hi>Chyle,</hi> and afterwards into <hi>humane fleſh:</hi> and the Acid of a Dogs Stomack converts the ſame Bread into Dogs Fleſh, as we are daily taught alſo by other Living Creatures; becauſe Nature works by the ſame Inſtruments in them all: as I have ſhewed in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Chapter out of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words: <hi>The ſoul of Man is increaſed in no other, but in Man,</hi> &amp;c. and from the ſame things of which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; and though <hi>Bread</hi> be fermented and Acid, as moſt Aliments are, either more or leſs; yet the Acid in the Stomack of a Man, though of it ſelf weak, hath yet a vitality joyned with it; whence it can obtain dominion over the ſame: As Vinegar gets dominion over and ſuppreſſeth the Acid innate in a Pearl; and <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> ſubdues the <hi>Acid</hi> in <hi>Silver,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Vital Aeidity</hi>
                        <pb n="81" facs="tcp:35121:129"/>of the Stomach ſubjugates the Acid Ferment of the Bread and other Aliments, and bears ſuch rule over them, as to convert and change them into its own nature: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, When a man eats a Capon, the Acid of his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack overcomes the radical moiſture of the Capon, and being predominant over it, transforms it into its own nature; on the contrary, if a Capon, or a Fiſh, could, or did eat a Man, his Vital Acid in the Stomack, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers and kills the radical moiſture left after death in mans fleſh; which then becomes the fleſh of a Capon.</p>
                     <p>Now that there is a Radical or Vital Moiſture remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Dead Carcaſs, appears by the <hi>Worms,</hi> which will infallibly breed there; and likewiſe by the growing of the nails and hair: And this not only <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> but many other curious Enquirers into Natural Things, have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And unleſs there were a Radical Moiſture remaining in Fleſh, and in all Aliments, fit and ſufficient nouriſhment could not be ſuppeditated to the <hi>Living;</hi> eſpecially to thoſe, who are growing and encreaſing: witneſs Fleſh and Fiſh ſalted and dried in the ſmoak, which have leſs Radical Moiſture than when they were freſh or new; for much of it is eaten up by the Salt (as <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> ſhews chap. 14.) and therefore they nouriſh leſs than if they were freſh. Wherefore <hi>Acid</hi> or <hi>Soft Fire,</hi> is to be found as well in the Vegetable and Mineral, as in the Animal Family; and it is <hi>That,</hi> which adorns every thing which is in the World; even as Water is <hi>That,</hi> which nouriſheth it, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> rightly ſpeaks. I ſay, by the preſence of this <hi>Fire and Water,</hi> both which do conſtitute the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Moiſture (as I ſhall ſhew) immediately before Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification, is the Acid of the Stomack enlightned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed; in regard it is more or leſs in all Aliments (as alſo in other things) as experience ſhews. There is more radical humidity in one new-laid Egg, than in an whole Pot full of Coleworts; more in one Cup of Wine, than in an whole Bucket of Water. Wherefore Acidity, being deficient in the Stomack (as <hi>Hippoc. Chymic.</hi> in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fore-cited plainly ſhews) is reſtored by the <hi>Radical Moiſture</hi> of Aliments; but chiefly and moſt of all, by that <hi>Geleſtial Food</hi> dwelling in the Air; for This is the Seed of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35121:130"/>Life, without which neither Man, nor other Animals, or any Vegetable can attain to Generation or Life; for that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Food or Attraction of the External Air, which by often breathing we ſuck in, doth ſo much conduce to the Life of Animals, that it hath cauſed not only Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, but alſo Plebeians to admire at it: Neither hath <hi>Nature</hi> Artificially placed her Bellows in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Heart, onely to cool it, as the Vulgar think, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but alſo that by their frequent Venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation they might ſuck in the Aethereal <hi>Aura,</hi> by whoſe <hi>afflatus</hi> and in-breathing, the aforeſaid Acid is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, and doth unceſſantly regerminate. For, as the Ingenious <hi>Coſmopolita</hi> ſhews before in the Third Chapter, as the Rain receives That Vertue of Life, and by the Sun Beams joyns it with the Alcaly of the Earth; ſo alſo the ſame Vertue of Life is attracted into the <hi>Microcoſme</hi> by Inſpiration, and is fixed by the Solar Beams of the Heart into the Alcaly, or Radical Moiſture of Animals; as I ſhall by and by Experimentally ſhew:</p>
                     <p>This is the True Ancient Learning and Doctrine of <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> concerning the <hi>Soft Fire</hi> Adorhing Bodies, which will always hold in deſpight of Rabious Maledicence, as <hi>He</hi> teſtifies in his Book <hi>de Carnibus,</hi> as well as <hi>Coſmc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polita;</hi> ſaying to the ſame ſenſe, <hi>I will alſo deliver my O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, That which we call</hi> Calid <hi>ſeems to me to be immortal, and to underſtand all Things; to Adorn, See, Hear, and Perceive all Things, both preſent and future; the greateſt part whereof in the general Perturbation of all Things, retired into the ſupream Appartiment; which the Ancients ſeem to me to have called Aether: The other part, obtaining the loweſt place, is called Earth, Cold and Dry, undergoing many muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein there is yet much Calidity:</hi> What can be ſpoken more clearly for the Radical Moiſture of Things? For That which <hi>Coſmopolita</hi> ſhews in the <hi>Macrocoſme</hi> (ſee Chap. 3.) the ſame things according to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> are to be underſtood in the <hi>Microcoſme;</hi> For Mans Body, unleſs it were required by that <hi>Immortal Calid,</hi> both by Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and alſo by Inſpiration, being Cold and Dry, would undergo many changes, and at length would crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to nothing before our Eyes, even as the flame of a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35121:130"/>Candle, when the Wax or Tallow is ſpent, or when it is blown out by the Wind; yet it doth not wholly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, as 'tis Vulgarly thought, and as it ſeems; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtitute of its <hi>Pabulum,</hi> is plucked from it, and ſo is ſcattered abroad and vaniſhes into Air, which is the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> and Univerſal Receptacle of the <hi>Lights</hi> and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Natures of the Material World; as <hi>Raymund</hi> hath it, and as the Text of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Book <hi>de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus</hi> doth a little before explain. Wherefore the chief Fewel and Food of Life, is ſupplied out of the <hi>Air</hi> to all the three Kingdoms: Hence the Ancients ſaid, <hi>Jovis om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia plena;</hi> and <hi>Coſmopolita</hi> affirms, that the <hi>hidden Food of Life is in the Air,</hi> which as I have ſhewed, aſſumes a Body to it ſelf, in an agreeable and conſentaneous root and ſubject.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore <hi>Innate Calid</hi> and <hi>Radical Humid</hi> differ much one from another, <hi>That</hi> is wholly Solar and Occultly Acid and Oily, but <hi>This</hi> is more Corporeous, Conſtnat, and Saline; <hi>That</hi> is of a Superior Order, <hi>This,</hi> of an Inferior; in which is that Country, where Man takes a Wife to himſelf, as <hi>Coſmopolita</hi> ſpeaks in his Tract <hi>de Sulphur;</hi> and it is the <hi>Hell,</hi> whether <hi>Plato</hi> is ſaid to have hurried <hi>Preſerpina;</hi> and <hi>Cores,</hi> her Mother, imploring Jupiters aid for her Redemption, was anſwered, That ſhe might return, if ſhe had taſted nothing in Hell <hi>(i. e.)</hi> unleſs that Celeſtial Spirit, the Child of the Sun, had not been abſorbed by the Alcaly, but as yet had dwelt free in the Air, then <hi>ſhe</hi> might have eaſily returned; but <hi>ſhe</hi> had taſted Grains of a <hi>Pomegranate</hi> in <hi>Eliſium (i. e.)</hi> in Pleaſure; for which Reaſon ſhe could not return, till ſix Months were expired <hi>(i. e.)</hi> till the <hi>Pomegranates</hi> were conſumed; and then <hi>Proſerpina</hi> returns to her Mother, as the Light of a Candle doth to its Source or Country, as I ſaid before. So that They are deceived, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Innate Calid</hi> and <hi>Radical Humid</hi> in all the Three Families; for they differ no leſs amongſt themſelves, than <hi>Aqua Cauſtica</hi> doth from <hi>Mercury,</hi> in which it takes a Body, as appears by the <hi>falſified or counterfeit Emplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> unjuſtly aſcribed to <hi>John de Vige.</hi> For in mixt Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the <hi>Radical Morſtar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Let Elementary Water be an Example, which being impregnated with the <hi>Child of the Sun,</hi> that is, with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial heat, falls upon the Radical Moiſture or Alcaly of a Vine, and is imbibed by it, and ſo becomes the <hi>ſame thing</hi> with it, as I have ſhewed in the Second and Third Chapter.</p>

This <hi>Vinegar</hi> is nothing elſe but Water impregnated with <hi>Acid Salt</hi> from the Principle of the Vine, and it is the Seed and Radical, <hi>Humid</hi> of its innate <hi>Celeſtial Fire:</hi> now ſpecificated by the <hi>Vine</hi> (for being pure, it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it ſelf to be handled by the impure hands of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, or of the Vulgar) and it is called by a common

                     <p>If you would have <hi>Proſerpina</hi> return to her Mother, then diſtil this <hi>Tartar,</hi> and there will come forth an Oil and Water which is bitteriſh by reaſon of the Oil, the Oil is that <hi>Pinguous,</hi> by which it was made <hi>Vinegar:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain imbibe this Oil and Water in Alcaly, and diſtil it, as before, and inſtead of the Oil there comes forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipld elementary Water; and ſo Water in the beginning is impregnated with Coeleſtical Calid, and afterwards 'tis changed by Fermentation into <hi>Grapes,</hi> then into <hi>Wine,</hi> then into <hi>Vinegar;</hi> at length 'tis made <hi>Salt</hi> in its Mother Alcaly, which is turned into <hi>Oil,</hi> and at laſt (as I have ſaid of the Light of a Candle, and of <hi>Proſerpina</hi>) it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to its Mother <hi>(i. e.)</hi> to <hi>Aether,</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpoke a little before.

                     <p>This arduous and obſcure <hi>Ferment</hi> hath ſo crazed the Brains of the Deans, and their Collegiats, though they think they were ſolid, ſtrong, and well grounded in Art, That they do altogether diſlike that <hi>Divinum.</hi> as a certain piacular thing, (which my <hi>Hippoc.

                     <p>But our <hi>Galen</hi> (even when he was old, deriding ſuch mens madneſs) together with many other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Men, had <hi>It</hi> in great eſteem, and (with <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>) conſeſſes in his 2. Book of the Differences of Feavors, Chap. 27. That It is placed in a certain ſecret affection, and that it doth inhere in the very parts, ſaying of intermittent Feavors, <hi>It ceaſes not to bring abcut the Circuitus of their Fits, as long as the Diſpoſition, in the generating part, is preſerved:</hi> whence it appears, that in that place he fetches the Cures of Feavors a little higher than he doth in his <hi>Books of Method</hi> and in his <hi>Firſt Book of Art</hi> to <hi>Glaxcoe;</hi> affirming, <hi>That the correction of this Diſpoſition, is the</hi> principle ſcope of the Cure; and in the ſame book, <hi>Where heat overcomes the matter, it is called increment.</hi> He means nothing elſe, but what my <hi>Hippoc.

                        <pb n="99" facs="tcp:35121:138"/>for if <hi>heat</hi> do overcome, it muſt needs have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the <hi>Matter or Alcaly,</hi> as I have abundantly proved by all examples both in the great and leſſer world; and then (ſayes <hi>Galen</hi>) <hi>Heat</hi> is encreaſed not only in Feavors, but alſo in all other Diſeaſes and Matters, as I have before ſhewed in Barly, a ſeed of the <hi>Macrocoſme;</hi> and now ſhall likewiſe ſhew even <hi>ad oculum</hi> in <hi>Paronychia (i. e.)</hi> (and impoſthumation under the root of the Nails) a ſeed of the Microcoſm. Now <hi>Paronychia,</hi> the Miſtreſs or Queen of almoſt all Diſeaſes, is an Igneous Tumour; ſo called from the moſt Acute pain accompanying it; the like whereof is hardly to be found amongſt Men; it ariſes in the root of the Nails <hi>(i. e.)</hi> in their Ventricle, when the Occult Ferment is by miſtake <hi>There</hi> made manifeſt and ſoured; in that very moment the vivid Aliment is perverted, the neighbouring parts are diſturbed, and ſometimes the Bones themſelves are eroded.</p>
                     <p>But this <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> is corrected by a more powerful <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid</hi> deſcending from a perfecter Family, which can ſubdue the inflamed Ferment of the <hi>Microcoſme:</hi> For before the <hi>Tumour</hi> be opened, it muſt be anointed over, and the whole Nail too, with <hi>Acid</hi> of Sulphur, as it is gathered <hi>Ex Campana,</hi> which by reaſon of its thickneſs they call <hi>Oil,</hi> when this Unction cauſeth pricking and itching a little in the part affected, in that very moment you may obſerve the corruptive <hi>Diſpoſition</hi> to be corrected, becauſe the more powerful <hi>Anima</hi> gets dominion over the weaker, no otherwiſe than as counterfeit Spirit of <hi>Venus</hi> ſubjugates the Occult <hi>Acid</hi> in a Pearl. Do but waſh your Finger with this warm Water, and it is enough. I would have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered many more of theſe things, for the benefit of my Neighbours, as alſo a pleaſant, ſafe and delightſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for the <hi>Lues Venerca</hi> it ſelf, unleſs I had been every where prevented by the <hi>deep Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Vienna</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors.</p>
                     <p>I know Learned Men, not a few, have by long uſe and experience taken notice of things, that do eradicate certain <hi>Diſpoſitions;</hi> but by reaſon of the multitude of <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norants</hi> in this woful age, which, with one mouth would raile againſt them (I am almoſt aſhamed to ſpeak it) they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35121:139"/>are afraid to publiſh Them, becauſe they exceed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of <hi>Gregarious</hi> and <hi>Talkative Medicks.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So the Vulgar Country People by proper Antidotes <hi>(i. e.)</hi> ſuch as ſpecifically deſtroy ſome <hi>Diſpoſitions,</hi> or do reſtrain, abſorb, or overcome the <hi>Acid</hi> and Ferment of the place) do ſometimes Cure not only Feavors, but many other Diſeaſes, without Purgation premiſed; whereby Old Women do ſometimes diſgrace, even the moſt able Phyſicians, and do counterfeit their Art; ſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> teaches in his Book <hi>de Affectionibus, If Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients ſeem to have no need of</hi> Pharmaca, <hi>give them Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Drink, by which the Feavor may be either changed or may abate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus,</hi> with <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> give many Examples of this <hi>Correction</hi> (as the former calls it) of <hi>Tranſmutation</hi> (as the latter) of <hi>Diſpoſitions;</hi> which being Cryptical, Abſtruſe, and Magnetical Works of Nature, and beſides are the Foundations of the Phyſick of our Predeceſſors, The <hi>Deans</hi> and their Colleagues have indeed read them, as appears, but being above their reach, and above <hi>Priſcians</hi> Grammar Rules, they could not underſtand Them, as appears by their reproachful can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; for therefore they aſperſe them, as not having <hi>learned to conſider obſcure things from manifeſt,</hi> as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly derides them, <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>de Diaeta.</hi> But if this Spiritual Operation be to be derided,<note place="margin">Wonderful are thy works O Lord <hi>&amp;c. Pſa.</hi> 91.</note> then ſurely, <hi>whole Nature,</hi> and the profound <hi>Science</hi> of True Phyſick will be alſo counted ridiculous. For whatſoever Nature works in the greater or leſſer world, ſhe always begins and ends it in a Spiritual manner; for the Creator hath given her no other <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to work withal: Out of a ſmall Seed of Hemp or Flax, there ariſeth a Plant, which having firſt undergone many vexatious Alterations, at length is made a <hi>Sail,</hi> by the help whereof, and by the blowing of the <hi>Winds,</hi> Men are carried up and down the World. This Action, from the beginning to the end, proceeds Spiritually, like Cryptography, as <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus</hi> ſhews in the fore-cited place. And alſo Mans Nature it ſelf, of Bread only and ſimple Water, doth not only frame for it ſelf the <hi>Body,</hi> which we touch, but alſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35121:139"/>the Optick <hi>Spirit</hi> of incomprehenſible Tenuity.<note place="margin">Bread and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are made Spirits.</note> None but the <hi>Norimberg</hi> and <hi>Auſtrian Collegiates</hi> and their fellows, would ever have called this Operation of Nature <hi>inept,</hi> Circum-foraneous, and Mountebank-like. So in the very Science of Phyſick, neither <hi>Rhubarb, Senna,</hi> nor <hi>Agarick,</hi> &amp;c. (their innate Spirit being taken away) can any longer diſturb Mans Body; neither, in their full ſtrength, if they could be given to a Carkaſs of a Man (the Spirit being gone) would they purge It. So that whatſoever is in <hi>Medicine,</hi> beſides the Clamours of the <hi>Deans</hi> and their Colleagues, like Cryptography, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds Spiritually; <hi>for we muſt needs confeſs, that all things do conſiſt of inſenſible Principles,</hi> as <hi>Lucretius</hi> ſays, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. Moreover one weight or parcel or Galls, and a fourth part of that weight of <hi>Vitriol</hi> (though neither of them black) yet being joyned together with an Aqueos Liquor,<note place="margin">Ink produced of Occult things.</note> by reaſon of the innate Spirit, do wax black, becauſe the <hi>Alcaly</hi> of the <hi>Galls</hi> doth ſuck up the <hi>Aoid Spirit</hi> of the <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Truly they uſe their Tongues ill, but their Ink worſe. But to make an end, I conclude with <hi>Lucretius,</hi> That both Learned and Unlearned muſt needs confeſs, <hi>That whatſoever the World hath, is produced of Cryptical and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things;</hi> Only theſe talkative <hi>Praters,</hi> to evidence to the whole World that they are vain and empty Bodies, without Spirit, do laugh at theſe <hi>Works</hi> of Nature, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their <hi>Inſtruments.</hi> They are a company of light, ungrateful, and ludicrous Birds, which I leave to be fed upon by ſuch hungry Stomachs as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire them; and ſo I return whence I digreſſed. The <hi>Aura</hi> of the Stomach, being endued with a forrain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, can creep to the joynts of the Foot (as the <hi>Aura</hi> of Common Sulphur can reach <hi>Sal Saturni,</hi> though far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from it, as I have experimentally ſhewed) and there it can ſo trouble the inhabiting Spirit, that the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35121:140"/>Aliment of the place waxes ſour, and pain ariſes, which from the place is called <hi>Podagrick.</hi> But of what <hi>Species</hi> this <hi>Acidity</hi> is, ſo tinged by the ſtrange or forrain <hi>Aura,</hi> Mans underſtanding cannot comprehend: Whence <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> in <hi>Fraeceptionum libello, By reaſon diverſe attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, ſometimes Diſeaſes ſtay a longer while.</hi> So that for the particulur Cure, That which is contary to theſe pains lies hid in the ſpecifick Alcaly, which thirſts after ſuch an Acid; as I have ſhewed concerning <hi>Iron</hi> for the Spleen, and concerning <hi>Oſtio Colla,</hi> &amp;. (ſee <hi>Hippocrates Chymic.</hi> Chap 28.) But for an external Remedy I have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeen the moſt vehement pain to have been mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by warm Water of Frogs Spawn,<note place="margin">Water of Frogs Spawn, rich in <hi>Alcaly,</hi> takes away Gowty inflamations.</note> which is rich of Volatile Alcaly, as <hi>Hippoc.

                     <p>So alſo there is preternaturally bred a ſtone found in the Gaul of an Hiſtrix or Hedghog,<note place="margin">The Stone of an Hiſtrix.</note> which ſuch Fablers, who are ignorant of the nature and cauſes of things, do mightily commend; eſpecially Thoſe, who would be accounted by Old Wives and the ignorant Vulgar <hi>Canonical Phyſicians:</hi> Whereas the <hi>Learned</hi> know, That Hypocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Medicine is but <hi>One,</hi> which needs be diſtinguiſhed but into <hi>Internal</hi> and <hi>External;</hi> whereas theſe Men, out of

I return to the ſtone growing in the Hedghogs Gaul, to which they aſcribe many imaginary Vertues; And out of meer ſimplicity which is not to be endured in Phyſick) do affirm, that it is of ſingular Vertue above the ſtones of all other Animals; grounding their opinion, on this weak argument, becauſe it is bitter to the taſte, not conſidering that it contracted the bitter taſt from the <hi>Gaul,</hi> part of which hath undergone coagulation with <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcaly,</hi> after the ſame manner, as the ſtone of the Kidneys, is many times red from the Blood, and That of the Bladder is white, by reaſon of the Mucilage mixed with it, which the Bladder doth exſude. For whatſoever the coagulating <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Alcaly,</hi> do lay hold of in haſty coagulation, being thruſt forth from the Vital Regiment, and doth not much receede from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of them both, they take <hi>It</hi> into their ſociety; juſt as Lime moiſtened with Water, again becomes <hi>a ſtony or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous coagulum</hi> with things mixed with it, as daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews.

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is plain, becauſe it is more common.

                     <p>But how came Great Perſons to know that the Vertues of this Stone were ſo excellent, ſeeing they cannot be learned, but by the knowledge of their Cauſes, and by manifold Experiences; witneſs <hi>Hippocrates de Lege.</hi> But Noble Men, or very few of them, ſtudy <hi>either,</hi> and therefore they muſt needs by a kind of adoption ſuck in this their knowledge from ſuch vain <hi>Fablers,</hi> to whom they <hi>ſubſcribe,</hi> and who make great but empty vaunts of their Skill in Phyſick; for they know not how to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh <hi>Vinegar</hi> from <hi>Salt,</hi> as I have proved, as clear as the Sun.</p>

                     <p>So the Stones of the Kidneys are of a <hi>Red</hi> Colour, by reaſon of the Blood which tranſudes or ſoaks thither by little and little out of the Veins, by reaſon of the <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bous Acid,</hi> and entering into the <hi>Coagulum</hi> tinges and dies the Stones.

And as the Magnete of all the Things and Metals in the World draws nothing but <hi>Iron,</hi> and is delighted with its <hi>Spirit,</hi> (neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the <hi>Rubigo</hi>) and the Stone of the <hi>hairy Serpent,</hi> rejoyces to attract the Odor of the Poiſon, infuſed by the venomous bitings, but it doth not attract Arſnick, Wolfs-bane, nor any other Poiſon; ſo alſo Jaſper draws an Exotick Spirit, which makes an Impetus in Mans Bloud.

                     <p>I have ſaid, That the Magnetick perceives Iron at a diſtance from it, and attracts it by its odor only, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be taken out of its Native Oil, for otherwiſe where it grows, it attracts nothing, becauſe there, in its Native Place, there is no want of the Odor of Iron.</p>

                     <p>Lime is inodorous of its ſelf, but when it is diſſolved in ſimple Water, for the building of Walls, the Acid acts upon the Alcaly, and on the contrary.

                        <note place="margin">Syrup of Wormwood.</note> that it might be of uſe to every individual? This, becauſe it is made up of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as of Pontick Wormwood, which is of an Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and Aſtringent Taſte, of Roſes, <hi>Indian</hi> Spike, moſt Odorous Plants, of Old Wine, of Juice of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces likewiſe binding, and Sugar, therefore they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them all to be boiled in an Earthen Veſſel being open, That ſo the Volatile Spirit of the Old Wine might carry off the Aromatick Odors, both of the Spike, as alſo of the Wormwood and Roſes; and ſo the Odors, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, can do no hurt to thoſe, who otherwiſe are not able to bear them (words in my <hi>Hippocrates Chymicus</hi> Chap. 30. either not underſtood, or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantly changed) and their Syrup may help a weak Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, not by the Odorous Spirit of Wine, but by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately Aſtringent Faculty. This is the reaſon why ſuch a Syrup was found out, as the <hi>Text</hi> witneſſes: From whence we learn the deep Judgment and diligent Obſervation of our <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> in compounding of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and why they appointed this Syrup to be <hi>Ino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorous?</hi> See for this the <hi>Tetras</hi> of <hi>Quercetan,</hi> conſult all Practicioners, and the <hi>Truth</hi> of the thing will appear; which, by how much the more it is oppreſſed, by thoſe that hate it, ſo much the more gloriouſly it triumphs and treads down <hi>falſity</hi> under her feet.

Hence it is, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in a paſſion commands. <hi>Scioliſts, to dip their Pens in their Minds, before they do it in Ink, leaſt one inconvenience being granted, a thouſand falſe concluſions do follow:</hi> As not only the Studiers of Ancient Phyſick do find to their great detriment, but Phyſick it ſelf (and that which is more to be lamented, the Sick)
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:35121:147"/>ſuffers under ſuch things, as manifeſtly appears in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Wormwood,</hi> which the Ancients appointed to be made without any ſmell, that it might be given for an Aſtringent to every individual; as clearly appears by the Reaſons and Experiences juſt now alleaged: but <hi>Theſe</hi> men, againſt the inſtitutions and precepts of Medicine, yea againſt the order of Nature her ſelf, do mixe it with Aromatized Spirit of Wine and that moſt odoriferous, and do ſo preſcribe it, being induced thereunto, by this falſe and vain opinion, <hi>That Odors are good indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently for all, both Men and Women.</hi> But with what fruit or profit they ſo think, Let Practicioners ſpeak, and let thoſe judge who have but the Spirit of a Man in their Breaſts, and who have ever ſeen the Female Sexe troubled with Uterine Diſtempers. I confeſs in a pedantick ſlaviſh Writer, this error were tolerable, and need only ſimple correction; but it is an abominable wickedneſs, and not to be endured in the <hi>Deans</hi> and their <hi>Colleagues,</hi> who ſore at ſuch <hi>High</hi> things, and boaſt that they can teach others Skill, themſelves being in the mean time ignorant of the common and ſafe way of healing, preſcribed by <hi>Galen,</hi> as I have ſhewed. For if, the Ancients (whom they inſult over) could find out Syrup of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and Syrup of Quinces, as we ſee in <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> what difficulty had it been for them to add odoriferous Spike and Roſes, if Odors and Spirit of Wine had been uſeful in this Compound? It appears by this, that They knew well <hi>a Dog from a black Sheep</hi> (to ſpeak prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bially) and could diſtinguiſh things, that ſmelt of Garlick, of the Hogſty, of the Sow and Goat mixed together. I have ſometimes admired, why not only <hi>Hippocrates</hi> enjoyned that we ſhould only ſpeak of Thoſe Things, which are known to Plebeians, but that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold, Holland,</hi> and many others have ſo induſtriouſly concealed the Ancient Foundations of this Art?
